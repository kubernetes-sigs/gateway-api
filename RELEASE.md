## Releasing a new version

- Write the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) with user-visible API changes. This must
  go through the regular PR review process and get merged into the `master` branch.
  Approval of the PR indicates community consensus for a new release.
- Once the above PR is merged, the author must publish a new Git tag. This can
  be done using the `git` CLI or Github's [release][release]
  page. This step can be performed only by [Gateway API maintainers][gateway-api-team].
