# Kubernetes Gateway API

The Gateway API is a part of the [SIG Network][sn], and this repository contains
the specification and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).

*Note: This project was previously named "Service APIs" until being renamed to
"Gateway API" in February 2021.*

## Status

The latest supported version is v1alpha1 as released by the [v0.3.0
release](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/tag/v0.3.0) of
this project. A second alpha API version, v1alpha2, is under active development,
but this is considered unstable and has not been released yet.

## Documentation
