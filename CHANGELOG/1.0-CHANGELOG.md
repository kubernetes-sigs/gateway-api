# v1.0.0

On behalf of Kubernetes SIG Network, we are pleased to announce the v1.0 release!
This release marks a huge milestone for this project. Several key APIs are
graduating to GA (generally available), while other significant features have
been added to the Experimental channel.

It's been four years since this project began, and we would never have gotten
here without the support of a dedicated and active community. The maintainers
would like to thanks _everyone_ who's contributed to Gateway API, whether in the
form of commits to the repo, discussion, ideas, or general support. We literally
couldn't have gotten this far without you.

This project is nowhere near finished, as you can see from the large amount of
features being added into the Experimental Channel. With such a big set of
things still to do, contributors and contributions are more vital than ever.
Please feel welcome to join our
[community!](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/)!

## Gateway, GatewayClass, and HTTPRoute are GA ðŸŽ‰

Gateway, GatewayClass, and HTTPRoute have all graduated to GA with a `v1` API
version. Although these APIs will continue to grow with future additions, the
versions of these resources available via the Standard Channel are stable and
recommended for use in production. Many implementations are fully passing
conformance tests that cover the functionality of each of these resources. These
APIs are graduating to GA with only minor spec clarifications since the v0.8.0
release.

## CEL Migration

Starting in v0.8.0, Gateway API CRDs now include CEL validation. In this release
the validating webhook is no longer bundled with CRD installation. Instead we
include a separate `webhook-install.yaml` file as part of the release artifacts.

If you're running Kubernetes 1.25+, we do not recommend installing the webhook
and additionally suggest that you uninstall any previously installed versions of
the webhook.

If you're still running Kubernetes 1.23 or 1.24, we recommend installing the
webhook until you can upgrade to Kubernetes 1.25 or newer.

## New Experimental Features

There are several exciting new experimental features in this release:

### BackendTLSPolicy
A new `BackendTLSPolicy` resource has been introduced for configuring TLS
connections from Gateways to Backends. This allows you to configure the Gateway
to validate the certificates served by Backends. For more information, refer to
[GEP 1897](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1897/).

Primary Author: @candita

### HTTPRoute Timeouts
HTTPRoute has a new `Timeouts` field on Route Rules. This allows you to
configure overall Request Timeouts as well as Backend Request Timeouts. For more
information, refer to [GEP 1742](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1742/).

Primary Authors: @frankbu, @SRodi

### Gateway Infrastructure Labels
Gateway has a new `Infrastructure` field that allows you to specify `Labels` or
`Annotations` that you'd like to be propagated to each resource generated for a
Gateway. For example, these labels and annotations may be copied to Services and
Deployments provisioned for in-cluster Gateways, or to other
implementation-specific resources, such as Cloud Load Balancers. For more
information, refer to [GEP
1762](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1762/).

Primary Author: @howardjohn

### WebSockets, HTTP/2, and More
Some coordinated work across both Gateway API and upstream Kubernetes has
defined 3 new values for the AppProtocol field on Service Ports:

* `kubernetes.io/h2c` - HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in
  [RFC7540](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540)
* `kubernetes.io/ws` - WebSocket over cleartext as described in
  [RFC6445](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)
* `kubernetes.io/wss` - WebSocket over TLS as described in
  [RFC6455](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)

These can now be used with Gateway API to describe the protocol to use for
connections to Kubernetes Services. For more information, refer to [GEP
1911](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1911/).

### A new CLI tool: gwctl
An experimental new CLI tool and kubectl plugin, gwctl aims to improve the UX
when interacting with Gateway API. Initially it is focused on Policy Attachment,
making it easier to understand which policies are available in a cluster, and
which have been applied. In future releases, we hope to expand the scope of this
tool to provide more detailed responses when getting and describing Gateway API
resources. Note that this tool is still in very early stages and it's very
likely that future releases will include breaking changes for gwctl. For more
information, refer to the [gwctl
Readme](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/tree/main/gwctl).

## Everything Else

Of course there's a lot more in this release:

### Spec Clarifications
- Clarify that the Gateway Listener status AttachedRoutes field is a count of
  the number of Routes associated with a Listener regardless of Gateway or Route
  status. (#2396, @sunjayBhatia)
- Gateway: A new concept called "Listener Isolation" has been introduced to
  describe the recommendation that at most one Listener matches a request, and
  only Routes attached to that Listener are used for routing. (#2465, @robscott)
- Experimental Channel: For ParentRefs to be considered distinct, they either
  both need to specify a distinct SectionName, both need to specify a distinct
  Port, or both. (#2433, @robscott)
- Updated rules about Listener uniqueness to use the term `distinct` (#2436,
  @youngnick)

### Status
- GatewayClass Status: A new experimental `supportedFeatures` field has been
  added. Implementations should populate this with the features they support.
  (#2461, @Liorlieberman, @robscott)
- GatewayClass Status: A new SupportedVersion condition has been added that MUST
  be set when a GatewayClass is accepted. (#2384, @robscott)
- Route Status: A new "PartiallyInvalid" condition has been added for all Route
  types. This condition also includes guidance for how partially invalid states
  should be handled with Gateway API. (#2429, @robscott)
- The condition reason `GatewayReasonUnsupportedAddress` for `Accepted` now ONLY
  applies when an address type is provided for a `Gateway` which it does not
  support.
  (#2412 @shaneutt)
- The condition reason `GatewayReasonAddressNotAssigned` for `Programmed` now
  ONLY applies to problems with dynamic address allocation.
  (#2412 @shaneutt)
- The condition reason `GatewayReasonAddressNotUsable` for `Programmed` has been
  added to deal with situations where a static address has been provided for a
  Gateway which is of a supported type, and is syntactically valid, but for some
  reason it cannot be used for this Gateway (e.g. the address is already in use
  on the network).
  (#2412 @shaneutt)

### Documentation
- A guide for Gateway API implementers is now included in the specification.
  (#2454, @youngnick)
- Gateway API versioning will continue to rely on two release channels -
  Standard and Experimental. New resources will start in the Experimental
  Channel with an alpha API Version and then graduate to the Standard Channel
  with a GA API version. Resources that already have Beta API versions will
  continue to have them, but no additional Gateway API resources will get a Beta
  API version. (#2446, @robscott)

### Cleanup
- Validating Webhook logs now use `Errorf` instead of `Fatalf`. (#2361, @yylt)

### Bug Fixes
* CEL validation for BackendTLSPolicy was fixed with corresponding tests added
  (#2491, @ygnas)
* Fixes the API version for `ReferenceGrant` from `v1` to `v1beta1` in the
  `GatewaySecretInvalidReferenceGrant` conformance test YAML (#2494, @arkodg)
* Gateway infrastructure field is now a pointer (#2508, @danehans)

## Conformance Tests
* h2c Backend Protocol conformance tests were added (#2456, @dprotaso)
* WebSocket Backend Protocol conformance tests were added (#2495, @dprotaso)
* New conformance test for Gateway Status AttachedRoutes (#2477, @danehans)
* Implemented the `ExemptFeatures` field for Experimental Conformance Profiles
  (#2515, @arkodg)

### Other (Cleanup or Flake)
- Resources related to the validating webhook such as the `gateway-system`
  namespace and the `gateway-api-admission-server` deployment have been removed
  from the installation manifests, in favor of CEL based Validations that are
  built into the CRD definition. These are still available in
  `webhook-install.yaml` in case you would like to optionally install them.
  (#2401, @arkodg)

# v1.0.0-rc2

The working group expects that this release candidate is quite close to the
final v0.8.0 release. However, breaking API changes are still possible.

This release candidate is suitable for implementors, but the working group does
not recommend shipping products based on a release candidate API due to the
possibility of incompatible changes prior to the final release. The following
represents the changes since v1.0.0-rc1:
