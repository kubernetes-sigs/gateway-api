# v1.2.0-rc2

This release candidate should be the same as the final v1.2.0 release.

This release candidate is suitable for implementors, but we do not recommend
shipping products based on a release candidate API due to the possibility of
incompatible changes prior to the final release. The following represents the
changes since v1.2.0-rc1:

## Breaking Changes

### `GRPCRoute` and `ReferenceGrant` `v1alpha2` removal

As per a previous deprecation notice, in this version, both Experimental
and Standard channel YAMLs will no longer serve the `v1alpha2` versions
of `GRPCRoute` and `ReferenceGrant`.

For the final release, we will provide pre-upgrade migration instructions
to cover folks who have been using the `v1alpha2` versions of these objects.

* Disable v1alpha2 versions for GRPCRoute and ReferenceGrant by @youngnick in
  [#3361](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3361)

## Documentation Changes

* Fix a number of GEP stage errors by @youngnick in
  [#3359](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3359)

## Testing and Conformance changes

* Add conformance suite client options by @BobyMCbobs in 
  [#3343](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3343)
* Fix conformance test race condition by @caboteria in
  [#3350](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3350)

# v1.2.0-rc1

We expect that this release candidate is quite close to the final v1.2.0
release. However, subsequent breaking API changes are still possible.

This release candidate is suitable for implementors, but we do not recommend
shipping products based on a release candidate API due to the possibility of
incompatible changes prior to the final release. The following represents the
changes since v1.1.0:

## Release Cycle changes

This was our first release using a new [release
cycle](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/release-cycle/) that is
meant to make Gateway API releases more frequent and predictable.

There are now four phases:

* **Scoping**: 4-6 weeks, where the maintainers and community determine the set
  of features we want to include in the release. A key deliverable here is
  ensuring that the Experimental channel does not get any bigger than it already
  is; we want to ensure that features make their way to Standard or are removed.
* **GEP Iteration and Review**: 5-7 weeks, where we work to update GEPs, and
  solidify and meet graduation criteria for in-scope GEPs.
* **API Refinement and Documentation**: 3-5 weeks, where we translate proposed
  changes from GEPs into changes to both the API specification and
  documentation.
* **SIG-Network Review and Release Candidates**: 2-4 weeks, where we perform our
  required upstream reviews, get any further required changes in, and release
  our release candidates so that implementations can get started with work on
  the new features asap.

For all the detail about this, please see the [Release Cycle
docs](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/contributing/release-cycle/).

## Standard Channel Additions and Changes

The Standard channel is Gateway API's set of maximally-stable install files.
Only features with the best testing and support are added to the standard
channel. This channel should be considered GA or stable, and future changes will
be fully backwards compatible.

### Infrastructure Labels and Annotations ðŸŽ‰

[GEP-1867](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1867/) added an
`infrastructure` stanza to Gateway objects that is intended to carry
infrastructure configuration specific to that Gateway object.

[GEP-1762](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1762/) adds a section for
`labels` and `annotations` to this stanza that specifies labels and annotations
to be annotated to all resources created to fulfill that Gateway request.

This feature can be used to affect the labels and annotations created on
LoadBalancer Services by in-cluster implementations to fulfill the Gateway
contract or by Cloud Load Balancing resources created by Cloud Providers.

This feature has graduated to Standard and is now considered GA or Stable.

This feature's name for conformance tests and GatewayClass status reporting is
`GatewayInfrastructurePropagation`.

This feature's status is **Extended**, meaning that it is _optional_ for
implementations to support. If you're using Experimental Channel, you can refer
to the `supportedFeatures` field in the `status` of any GatewayClass.

Relevant PRs:
* Remove experimental from gateway infrastructure by @keithmattix in
  [#3272](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3272)
* Validation for label keys and values according to Kubernetes specification by
  @snorwin in [#3284](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3284)

### HTTPRoute Timeouts and Durations ðŸŽ‰

The HTTPRoute `Timeouts` field on Route Rules has graduated to Standard and is
now considered GA or Stable.

This field allows you to configure overall Request Timeouts as well as Backend
Request Timeouts. For more information, refer to [GEP
1742](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1742/).

The relevant feature names this for conformance tests and GatewayClass status
reporting are:

* `HTTPRouteRequestTimeout` for `httproute.spec.rules[].timeouts.request`
* `HTTPRouteBackendTimeout` for `httproute.spec.rules[].timeouts.backendRequest`

This feature's status is **Extended**, meaning that it is _optional_ for
implementations to support. If you're using Experimental Channel, you can refer
to the `supportedFeatures` field in the `status` of any GatewayClass.

Relevant PRs:
* Graduate GEP-2257 and GEP-1742 to standard by @kflynn in
  [#3210](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3210)
* GEP2257 Duration parsing by @xtineskim in
  [#3271](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3271)

### BackendProtocol Support ðŸŽ‰

The previous coordinated work across both Gateway API and upstream Kubernetes
which defined 3 new values for the AppProtocol field on Service Ports has
graduated to Standard and is now considered GA or Stable.

The values are:

* `kubernetes.io/h2c` - HTTP/2 over cleartext as described in
  [RFC7540](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540)
* `kubernetes.io/ws` - WebSocket over cleartext as described in
  [RFC6445](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)
* `kubernetes.io/wss` - WebSocket over TLS as described in
  [RFC6455](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455)

These can now be used with Gateway API to describe the protocol to use for
connections to Kubernetes Services. For more information, refer to [GEP
1911](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1911/).

The relevant feature names this for conformance tests and GatewayClass status
reporting are:

* `HTTPRouteBackendProtocolH2C` for H2C support, when
  `service.spec.ports[].appProtocol` is `kubernetes.io/h2c`.
* `HTTPRouteBackendProtocolWebSocket` for Websocket support, when
  `service.spec.ports[].appProtocol` is `kubernetes.io/ws` or
  `kubernetes.io/wss`.

This feature's status is **Extended**, meaning that it is _optional_ for
implementations to support. If you're using Experimental Channel, you can refer
to the `supportedFeatures` field in the `status` of any GatewayClass.

Relevant PRs:
* Backend Protocol Selection is no longer experimental and is now part of
  HTTPRoute Extended Conformance by @dprotaso in
  [#3108](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3108)

### Other Standard channel changes

* Increased the limit on HTTPRoute matches from 8 to 64 by @howardjohn in
  [#3205](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3205)
* Adds the GatewayClassConditionReason "Unsupported" and clarifies when

  [#3185](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3185)

## Experimental Channel Additions and Changes

The Experimental Channel is Gateway API's channel for testing out changes and
gaining confidence with them before allowing them to go to Standard.

**This channel may include features that are changed or removed later!**

### BREAKING CHANGE

The Experimental `supportedFeatures` field in GatewayClass `status` has changed
from being a list of strings to being a list of objects/structs with a `name`
field.

This is to allow addding in extra information to each entry at a later date.

Relevant PRs:

* SupportedFeatures field in Gateway Class status are now presented as a list of
  objects by @LiorLieberman in
  [#3200](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3200)

### HTTPRoute Retry support

[GEP-1731](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1731/) described how to add
configuration of retries on HTTPRoute objects, and in this release, this change
has moved to Experimental.

Please see the GEP reference document or the API reference for the details.

This feature has graduated to Experimental amd should now be used for testing
and verification purposes only. Experimental features may be changed or removed
in a future version.

This feature does not currently have a feature name defined.

This feature's status is **Extended**, meaning that it is _optional_ for
implementations to support.

As there is no feature name or conformance tests available for this feature as
yet, please see your implementation's documentation to see if it is supported.

Relevant PRs:

* Adds support for configuring retries in HTTPRoute by @mikemorris in
  [#3301](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3301)
* Adds `retry` stanza within HTTPRouteRule to configure retrying unsuccessful
  requests to backends before sending a response to a client by @mikemorris in
  [#3199](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3199)

### Percentage-based request mirroring

The existing Request Mirroring feature has been enhanced by allowing users to
specify a percentage of requests they'd like mirrored. These changes are
described in [GEP-3171](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-3171/).

Please see the GEP reference document or the API reference for the details.

This feature has graduated to Experimental amd should now be used for testing
and verification purposes only. Experimental features may be changed or removed
in a future version.

This feature does not currently have a feature name defined.

* Add Additional API Testing for GEP-3171 by @jakebennert in
  [#3302](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3302)

### Improvements to backend TLS configuration

Some changes have been made to Gateway API's support for configuring TLS
connections between the Gateway and backends.

Gateway has a new Experimental field that contains configuration for the client
certificate Gateways should use when connecting to Backends.

The existing BackendTLSPolicy object has had additions as well:

* Ability to specify SANs on BackendTLSPolicy
* Add TLS options to BackendTLSPolicy to mirror TLS config on Gateways

See [GEP-3155](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-3155/) for all the
details.

This feature has graduated to Experimental amd should now be used for testing
and verification purposes only. Experimental features may be changed or removed
in a future version.

  [#3304](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/3304)

### Named Route Rules

All Route Rule types (GRPCRouteRule, HTTPRouteRule, TCPRouteRule, TLSRouteRule
and UDPRouteRule) have had a new, optional `name` field to support referencing
individual rules by name.

This name, if present, may be used in `status` and logging to indicate which
route rule is being referenced in messages in a more readable way than an array
index.

This feature has graduated to Experimental amd should now be used for testing
and verification purposes only. Experimental features may be changed or removed
in a future version.

This feature does not currently have a feature name defined.

This feature's status is **Extended**, meaning that it is _optional_ for

## Leadership changes

In this release timeframe, Gateway API has been working on building our
contributor pool and promoting more contributors up our contributor ladder.

Congratulations to @mlavacca on being promoted into the core Gateway API
maintainer team!

Thanks to @keithmattix for all your work as one of the GAMMA leads, and
congratulations to @mikemorris on being promoted into the GAMMA lead team.

We've added two new GEP Reviewers: @kflynn and @arkodg

Also promoted in the conformance team:

* @LiorLieberman is now an Approver
* @candita is now a Reviewer

Last but most certainly not least, @guicassolato has become a reviewer for
`gwctl`.

Congratulations to everyone on the promotions, and thanks for your continued
contributions to the Gateway API community!

## `gwctl`

In this release, gwctl is moving to a separate repo:
[kubernetes-sigs/gwctl](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gwctl). This will
enable a more flexible and independent release process. Significant new updates
are coming to gwctl, follow the new repo for the latest updates on that project.

Although these changes won't be part of Gateway API v1.2 and will instead be
part of the separate gwctl release, we're noting them as they were merged while
the project was part of this repo:
