                      A new Gateway API version for standard channel has been released and we need to publish the corresponding blog post.

                      **Release Name:** ${{ github.event.release.name }}
                      **Tag:** ${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}
                      **Date Created:** ${{ github.event.release.created_at }}

                      Release announcement should go live within 30 days from the date created, and the draft PR should be proposed to the `kubernetes/website` repository at least 14 days before the go-live date for sigs-doc team to give enough time for review.
