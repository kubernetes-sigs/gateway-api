The content of this document is taken from the API sketch . We will try to keep the two documents in sync as the sketch document has to lowest bar to contribution, but this document is easier to format well and review. Roles and personas In the original design of Kubernetes, the Ingress and Service resources were based on a self-service model of usage; developers who create Services and Ingresses control all aspects of defining and exposing their applications to their users. We have found that the self-service model does not fully capture some of the more complex deployment and team structures that our users are seeing. The Gateway/Routes API will target the following personas: Infrastructure provider : The infrastructure provider (infra) is responsible for the overall environment that the cluster(s) are operating in. Examples include: the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, ...), the PaaS provider in a company. Cluster operator : The cluster operator (ops) is responsible for administration of entire clusters. They manage policies, network access, application permissions. Application developer : The application developer (dev) is responsible for defining their application configuration (e.g. timeouts, request matching/filter) and Service composition (e.g. path routing to backends). We expect that each persona will map approximately to a Role in the Kubernetes Role-Based Authentication (RBAC) system and will define resource model responsibility and separation. Depending on the environment, multiple roles can map to the same user. For example, giving the user all of the above role replicates the self-service model. Resource model Note: Resource will initially live in the networking.x-k8s.io API group as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). Unqualified resource names will implicitly be assumed to be part of this API group. Our resource model is based around a separation of concerns for a service producer. Each resource is intended to be (mostly) independently-evolvable and self-consistent: A way to group pods (backends) into a set via label selection: Kubernetes core.Service , independent of application-level routing. A way to describe application-level routing: xxxxRoute , e.g. HTTPRoute , TCPRoute independent of traffic access and consumption (e.g. A way to describe traffic access and consumption: Gateway independent of implementation. A way to describe which implementations of traffic access are available: GatewayClass . The combination of GatewayClass , Gateway , xxxxRoute and Service (s) will define an implementable load-balancer. The diagram below illustrates the relationships between the different resources: Design considerations There are some general design guidelines used throughout this API. Single resource consistency The Kubernetes API guarantees consistency only on a single resource level. There are a couple of consequences for complex resource graphs as opposed to single resources: Error checking of properties spanning multiple resource will be asynchronous. Simple syntax checks will be possible at the single resource level, but cross resource dependencies will need to be handled by the controller. Controllers will need to handle broken links between resources and/or mismatched configuration. Conflicts Separation and delegation of responsibility among independent actors (e.g between cluster ops and application developers) can result in conflicts in the configuration. For example, two application teams may inadvertently submit configuration for the same HTTP path. There are several different strategies for handling this: TODO Extensibility TODO GatewayClass GatewayClass is cluster-scoped resource defined by the infrastructure ops. This resource represents a category of Gateways that can be instantiated. apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1 kind: GatewayClass metadata: name: from-internet controller: # links to a custom resource apiGroup: networking.acme.io # that implements this class. kind: cloud-lb name: from-internet A sample controller file: apiVersion: networking.acme.io/v1alpha1 kind: CloudLB metadata: name: from-internet networkTier: auto ipAllocation: auto We expect that one or more GatewayClasses will be created by the infrastructure provider for the user as part of their cloud infrastructure. If the cluster operator wishes to customize their GatewayClasses , they are free to do so, interacting with the custom resource parameters. Example parameters GatewayClass.controller resource will include cluster-level defaults and constraints. The community may converge around a common set of GatewayClass names with well-known meanings (e.g. internet , private ) to ease interoperability between platforms. Gateway A Gateway is 1:1 with the life cycle of the configuration of LB infrastructure. When a user creates a Gateway , a load balancer is provisioned (see below for details) by the GatewayClass controller. Gateway is the resource that triggers actions in this API. Other resources in this API are configuration snippets until a Gateway has been created to link the resources together. The Gateway spec defines the following: GatewayClass used to instantiate this Gateway. Listener bindings, which define addresses and ports, protocol termination, TLS-settings. Listener configuration requested by a Gateway definition can be incompatible with a given GatewayClass (e.g. port/protocol combination is not supported) . In this case, the Gateway will be in an error state, signalled by the status field. Routes, which point to a set of protocol-specific routing served by the Gateway. OPTIONAL: A Gateway can point directly to Kubernetes Service if no advanced routing is required. Deployment models Depending on the GatewayClass , the creation of the Gateway could do any of the following actions: Use cloud APIs to create an LB instance. Spawn a new instance of a software LB (in this or another cluster). Add a configuration stanza to an already instantiated LB to handle the new routes. Program the SDN to implement the configuration. Something else we haven\u2019t thought of yet... The API does not specify which one of these actions will be taken. Note that a GatewayClass controller that manages in-cluster proxy processes MAY restrict Gateway configuration scope, e.g. only be served in the same namespace.
