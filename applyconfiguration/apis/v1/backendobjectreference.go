// specific to BackendRef. It includes a few additional fields and features
// than a regular ObjectReference.
//
// Note that when a namespace different than the local namespace is specified, a
// ReferenceGrant object is required in the referent namespace to allow that
// namespace's owner to accept the reference. See the ReferenceGrant
// documentation for details.
//
// The API object must be valid in the cluster; the Group and Kind must
// be registered in the cluster for this reference to be valid.
//
// References to objects with invalid Group and Kind are not valid, and must
// be rejected by the implementation, with appropriate Conditions set
// on the containing object.
