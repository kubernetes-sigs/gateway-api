	// GatewayClassName used for this Gateway. This is the name of a
	// GatewayClass resource.
	GatewayClassName *apisv1.ObjectName `json:"gatewayClassName,omitempty"`
	// Listeners associated with this Gateway. Listeners define
	// logical endpoints that are bound on this Gateway's addresses.
	// At least one Listener MUST be specified.
	//
	// ## Distinct Listeners
	//
	// Each Listener in a set of Listeners (for example, in a single Gateway)
	// MUST be _distinct_, in that a traffic flow MUST be able to be assigned to
	// exactly one listener. (This section uses "set of Listeners" rather than
	// "Listeners in a single Gateway" because implementations MAY merge configuration
	// from multiple Gateways onto a single data plane, and these rules _also_
	// apply in that case).
	//
	// Practically, this means that each listener in a set MUST have a unique
	// combination of Port, Protocol, and, if supported by the protocol, Hostname.
	//
	// Some combinations of port, protocol, and TLS settings are considered
	// Core support and MUST be supported by implementations based on the objects
	// they support:
	//
	// # HTTPRoute
	//
	// 1. HTTPRoute, Port: 80, Protocol: HTTP
	// 2. HTTPRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: HTTPS, TLS Mode: Terminate, TLS keypair provided
	//
	// # TLSRoute
	//
	// 1. TLSRoute, Port: 443, Protocol: TLS, TLS Mode: Passthrough
	//
	// "Distinct" Listeners have the following property:
	//
	// **The implementation can match inbound requests to a single distinct
	// Listener**.
	//
	// When multiple Listeners share values for fields (for
	// example, two Listeners with the same Port value), the implementation
	// can match requests to only one of the Listeners using other
	// Listener fields.
	//
	// When multiple listeners have the same value for the Protocol field, then
	// each of the Listeners with matching Protocol values MUST have different
	// values for other fields.
	//
	// The set of fields that MUST be different for a Listener differs per protocol.
	// The following rules define the rules for what fields MUST be considered for
	// Listeners to be distinct with each protocol currently defined in the
	// Gateway API spec.
	//
	// The set of listeners that all share a protocol value MUST have _different_
	// values for _at least one_ of these fields to be distinct:
	//
	// * **HTTP, HTTPS, TLS**: Port, Hostname
	// * **TCP, UDP**: Port
	//
	// One **very** important rule to call out involves what happens when an
	// implementation:
	//
	// * Supports TCP protocol Listeners, as well as HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocol
	// Listeners, and
	// * sees HTTP, HTTPS, or TLS protocols with the same `port` as one with TCP
	// Protocol.
	//
	// In this case all the Listeners that share a port with the
	// TCP Listener are not distinct and so MUST NOT be accepted.
	//
	// If an implementation does not support TCP Protocol Listeners, then the
	// previous rule does not apply, and the TCP Listeners SHOULD NOT be
	// accepted.
	//
	// Note that the `tls` field is not used for determining if a listener is distinct, because
	// Listeners that _only_ differ on TLS config will still conflict in all cases.
	//
	// ### Listeners that are distinct only by Hostname
	//
	// When the Listeners are distinct based only on Hostname, inbound request
	// hostnames MUST match from the most specific to least specific Hostname
	// values to choose the correct Listener and its associated set of Routes.
	//
	// Exact matches MUST be processed before wildcard matches, and wildcard
	// matches MUST be processed before fallback (empty Hostname value)
	// matches. For example, `"foo.example.com"` takes precedence over
	// `"*.example.com"`, and `"*.example.com"` takes precedence over `""`.
	//
	// Additionally, if there are multiple wildcard entries, more specific
	// wildcard entries must be processed before less specific wildcard entries.
	// For example, `"*.foo.example.com"` takes precedence over `"*.example.com"`.
	//
	// The precise definition here is that the higher the number of dots in the
	// hostname to the right of the wildcard character, the higher the precedence.
	//
	// The wildcard character will match any number of characters _and dots_ to
	// the left, however, so `"*.example.com"` will match both
	// `"foo.bar.example.com"` _and_ `"bar.example.com"`.
	//
	// ## Handling indistinct Listeners
	//
	// If a set of Listeners contains Listeners that are not distinct, then those
	// Listeners are _Conflicted_, and the implementation MUST set the "Conflicted"
	// condition in the Listener Status to "True".
	//
	// The words "indistinct" and "conflicted" are considered equivalent for the
	// purpose of this documentation.
	//
	// Implementations MAY choose to accept a Gateway with some Conflicted
	// Listeners only if they only accept the partial Listener set that contains
	// no Conflicted Listeners.
	//
	// Specifically, an implementation MAY accept a partial Listener set subject to
	// the following rules:
	//
	// * The implementation MUST NOT pick one conflicting Listener as the winner.
	// ALL indistinct Listeners must not be accepted for processing.
	// * At least one distinct Listener MUST be present, or else the Gateway effectively
	// contains _no_ Listeners, and must be rejected from processing as a whole.
	//
	// The implementation MUST set a "ListenersNotValid" condition on the
	// Gateway Status when the Gateway contains Conflicted Listeners whether or
	// not they accept the Gateway. That Condition SHOULD clearly
	// indicate in the Message which Listeners are conflicted, and which are
	// Accepted. Additionally, the Listener status for those listeners SHOULD
	// indicate which Listeners are conflicted and not Accepted.
	//
	// ## General Listener behavior
	//
	// Note that, for all distinct Listeners, requests SHOULD match at most one Listener.
	// For example, if Listeners are defined for "foo.example.com" and "*.example.com", a
	// request to "foo.example.com" SHOULD only be routed using routes attached
	// to the "foo.example.com" Listener (and not the "*.example.com" Listener).
	//
	// This concept is known as "Listener Isolation", and it is an Extended feature
	// of Gateway API. Implementations that do not support Listener Isolation MUST
	// clearly document this, and MUST NOT claim support for the
	// `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature.
	//
	// Implementations that _do_ support Listener Isolation SHOULD claim support
	// for the Extended `GatewayHTTPListenerIsolation` feature and pass the associated
	// conformance tests.
	//
	// ## Compatible Listeners
	//
	// A Gateway's Listeners are considered _compatible_ if:
	//
	// 1. They are distinct.
	// 2. The implementation can serve them in compliance with the Addresses
	// requirement that all Listeners are available on all assigned
	// addresses.
	//
	// Compatible combinations in Extended support are expected to vary across
	// implementations. A combination that is compatible for one implementation
	// may not be compatible for another.
	//
	// For example, an implementation that cannot serve both TCP and UDP listeners
	// on the same address, or cannot mix HTTPS and generic TLS listens on the same port
	// would not consider those cases compatible, even though they are distinct.
	//
	// Implementations MAY merge separate Gateways onto a single set of
	// Addresses if all Listeners across all Gateways are compatible.
	//
	// In a future release the MinItems=1 requirement MAY be dropped.
	//
	// Support: Core
	Listeners []ListenerApplyConfiguration `json:"listeners,omitempty"`
	// Addresses requested for this Gateway. This is optional and behavior can
	// depend on the implementation. If a value is set in the spec and the
	// requested address is invalid or unavailable, the implementation MUST
	// indicate this in an associated entry in GatewayStatus.Conditions.
	//
	// The Addresses field represents a request for the address(es) on the
	// "outside of the Gateway", that traffic bound for this Gateway will use.
	// This could be the IP address or hostname of an external load balancer or
	// other networking infrastructure, or some other address that traffic will
	// be sent to.
	//
	// If no Addresses are specified, the implementation MAY schedule the
	// Gateway in an implementation-specific manner, assigning an appropriate
	// set of Addresses.
	//
	// The implementation MUST bind all Listeners to every GatewayAddress that
	// it assigns to the Gateway and add a corresponding entry in
	// GatewayStatus.Addresses.
