# The GAMMA initiative (Gateway API for Service Mesh)

!!! danger "Experimental in v0.8.0"

    GAMMA support for service mesh use cases is _experimental_ in `v0.8.0`.
    It is possible that it will change; we do not recommend it in production
    at this point.

The Gateway API was originally designed to manage traffic from clients outside
the cluster to services inside the cluster -- the _ingress_ or
[_north/south_][north/south traffic] case. Over time, though, interest from
[service mesh] users prompted the creation of the GAMMA (**G**ateway **A**PI
for **M**esh **M**anagement and **A**dministration) initiative in 2022 to
define how the Gateway API could also be used for inter-service or
[_east/west_ traffic][east/west traffic] within the same cluster.

The GAMMA initiative is a dedicated workstream within the Gateway API
subproject, rather than being a separate subproject. GAMMAâ€™s goal is to define
how the Gateway API can be used to configure a service mesh, with the
intention of making minimal changes to the Gateway API and always preserving
the [role-oriented] nature of the Gateway API. Additionally, we strive to
advocate for consistency between implementations of the Gateway API by service
mesh projects, regardless of their technology stack or proxy.

## Deliverables

The work of the GAMMA intiative will be captured in [Gateway Enhancement
Proposals][geps] that extend or refine the Gateway API specification to cover
mesh and mesh-adjacent use cases. To date, these have been relatively small
changes (albeit sometimes with relatively large impacts!) and we expect that
to continue. Governance of the Gateway API specification remains solely with
the maintainers of the Gateway API subproject.

The ideal final outcome of the GAMMA initiative is that service mesh use cases
become a first-party concern of the Gateway API, at which point there will be
no further need for a separate initiative.

## Contributing

We welcome contributors of all levels! There are [many ways to
contribute][contributor-ladder] to the Gateway API and GAMMA, both technical
and non-technical.

The simplest way to get started is to attend one of GAMMA's regular meetings,
which happen every two weeks on Tuesdays for 1 hour (as found on the
[sig-network calendar]), alternating between 3pm PT and 8am PT slots to try to
be as time-zone inclusive as possible. GAMMA meetings will be moderated by the
[GAMMA leads] with notes taken by a volunteer. Community members should feel
free to attend both GAMMA and Gateway API meetings, but are by no means
obligated to do so.

## An Overview of the Gateway API for Service Mesh

!!! danger "Experimental in v0.8.0"

    GAMMA support for service mesh use cases is _experimental_ in `v0.8.0`.
    It is possible that it will change; we do not recommend it in production
    at this point.

GAMMA has, to date, been able to define service mesh support in the Gateway
API with relatively small changes. The most significant change that GAMMA has
introduced to date is that, when configuring a service mesh, individual route
resources (such as [HTTPRoute]) are [associated directly with Service
resources](#gateway-api-for-mesh).

This is primarily because there will typically only be one mesh active in the
cluster, so the [Gateway] and [GatewayClass] resources are not used when
working with a mesh. In turn, this leaves the Service resource as the most
universal binding point for routing information.

Since the Service resource is unfortunately complex, with several overloaded
or underspecified aspects, GAMMA has also found it critical to formally define
the [Service _frontend_ and _backend_ facets][service-facets]. In brief:

- The Service frontend is its name and cluster IP, and
- The Service backend is its collection of endpoint IPs.

This distinction helps the Gateway API to be exact about how routing within a
mesh functions, without requiring new resources that largely duplicate the
Service.

## How the Gateway API works for Service Mesh <a name="gateway-api-for-mesh">

GAMMA specifies that individual Route resources attach directly to a Service,
representing configuration meant to be applied to _any traffic directed to the
Service_.

!!! danger "Experimental in v0.8.0"

    Binding Routes directly to Services seems to be the current best choice
    for configuring mesh routing, but it is still **experimental** and thus
    **subject to change**.

When one or more Routes are attached to a Service, **requests that do not
match at least one of the Routes will be rejected**. If no Routes are attached
to a Service, requests to the Service simply proceed per the mesh's default
behavior (usually resulting in the request being forwarded as if the mesh were
not present).

Which Routes attach to a given Service is controlled by the Routes themselves
(working with Kubernetes RBAC): the Route simply specifies a `parentRef` that
is a Service, rather than a Gateway.

```yaml
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: smiley-route
  namespace: faces
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - name: smiley
      kind: Service
      group: core
      port: 80
  rules:
    ...
```

The relationship between the Route's Namespace and the Service's Namespace is
important:

- Same Namespace <a name="producer-routes"></a>

    !!! note "Work in Progress"

        There is ongoing work around the relationship between producer
        routes and consumer routes.

    A Route in the same Namespace as its Service is called a [producer route],
    since it is typically created by the creator of the workload in order to
    define acceptable usage of the workload (for example, [Ana] would deploy
    both the workload and the Route). All requests from any client of the
    workload, from any Namespace, will be affected by this Route.

    The Route shown above is a producer route.

- Different Namespaces <a name="consumer-routes"></a>

    !!! note "Work in Progress"

        There is ongoing work around the relationship between producer
        routes and consumer routes.

    A Route in a different Namespace than its Service is called a [consumer
    route]. Typically, this is a Route meant to refine how a consumer of a
    given workload makes request of that workload (for example, configuring
    custom timeouts for that consumer's use of the workload). This Route will
    only affect requests from workloads in the same Namespace as the Route.

    For example, this HTTPRoute would cause all clients of the `smiley`
    workload in the `fast-clients` Namespace to have a 100ms timeout:

    ```yaml
    kind: HTTPRoute
    metadata:
      name: smiley-route
      namespace: fast-clients
    spec:
      parentRefs:
      - name: smiley
        namespace: faces
        kind: Service
        group: core
        port: 80
      rules:
        ...
        timeouts:
          request: 100ms
    ```

One important note about Routes bound to Services is that multiple Routes for
the same Service in a single Namespace - whether producer routes or consumer
routes - will be combined according to the Gateway API [Route merging rules].
As such, it is not currently possible to define distinct consumer routes for
multiple consumers in the same Namespace.

For example, if the `blender` workload and the `mixer` workload both live in
the `foodprep` Namespace, and both call the `oven` workload using the same
Service, it is not currently possible for `blender` and `mixer` to use
HTTPRoutes to set different timeouts for their calls to the `oven` workload.
`blender` and `mixer` would need to be moved into separate Namespaces to allow
this.

## Request Flow

A typical [east/west] API request flow when a GAMMA-compliant mesh is in use
looks like:

1. A client workload makes a request to <http://foo.ns.service.cluster.local>.
2. The mesh data plane intercepts the request and identifies it as traffic for
   the Service `foo` in Namespace `ns`.
3. The data plane locates Routes associated with the `foo` Service, then:

    a. If there are no associated Routes, the request is always allowed, and
       the `foo` workload itself is considered the destination workload.

    b. If there are associated Routes and the request matches at least one of
       them, the `backendRefs` of the highest-priority matching Route are used
       to select the destination workload.

    c. If there are associated Routes, but the request matches none of them,
       the request is rejected.

6. The data plane routes the request on to the destination workload (most
   likely using [endpoint routing], but it is allowed to use [Service
   routing]).
