## Implementations

In this section you will find specific links to blog posts, documentation and other Gateway API references for specific implementations.

### Acnodal EPIC
[EPIC][epicdocs] is an Open Source External Gateway platform designed and built with Kubernetes.  It consists of the Gateway Cluster, k8s Gateway controller, a stand alone Linux Gateway controller and the Gateway Service Manager.  Together they create a platform for providing Gateway services to cluster users.   Each gateway consists of multiple Envoy instances running on the gateway cluster not the workload clusters. The Gateway Service Manager is a simple user management and UI that can be used to implement Gateway-as-a-Service infrastructure for public and private clusters, and integrate non-k8s endpoints.

### Knative

[Knative][knative] is a serverless platform built on Kubernetes.  Knative Serving provides a simple API for running stateless containers with automatic management of URLs, traffic splitting between revisions, request-based autoscaling (including scale to zero), and automatic TLS provisioning.  Knative Serving supports multiple HTTP routers through a plugin architecture, including a [gateway API plugin][knative-net-gateway-api] which is currently in alpha as not all Knative features are supported.

### Kuadrant

[Kuadrant][kuadrant] is an open source multi cluster Gateway API controller that integrates with and provides policies to other Gateway API providers.

Kuadrant supports Gateway API for defining gateways centrally and attaching policies such as DNS, TLS, Auth and Rate Limiting that apply to all gateway instances in a multi cluster environment.
Kuadrant works with Istio as the underlying gateway provider, with plans to work with other gateway providers such as Envoy Gateway.

For help and support with Kuadrant's implementation please feel free to [create an issue][kuadrant-issue-new] or ask for help in the [#kuadrant channel on Kubernetes slack][kuadrant-slack].
