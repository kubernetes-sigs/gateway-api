## Project References

In this section you will find specific links to blog posts, documentation and other Gateway API references for specific implementations.

### Contour

[Contour][contour] is an open source ingress controller for Kubernetes.

Contour currently implements much of Gateway API `v0.3.0`.

See the [Contour Gateway API Guide][contour-1] for information on how to deploy and use Contour's Gateway implementation.

_Note that not all of the `v0.3.0` specification is completed yet, [contributions welcome!][contour-2]._

### Emissary-Ingress (Ambassador API Gateway)

[Emissary-Ingress][emissary] (formerly known as Ambassador API Gateway) is an open source CNCF project that
provides an ingress controller and API gateway for Kubernetes built on top of [Envoy Proxy][envoy].
See [here][emissary-gateway-api] for more details on using the Gateway API with Emissary.

### Gloo Edge

Gloo Edge 2.0 is an Istio-native, fully-featured Envoy based API gateway that brings [Gloo Edge][glooedge] functionality to Istio. The [Solo.io][solo] team is actively working towards an implementation of the Gateway API.

### Google Kubernetes Engine

[Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)][gke] is a managed Kubernetes platform
offered by Google Cloud. GKE's implementation of the Gateway API is through the 
[GKE Gateway controller][gke-gateway] (currently in Preview) which provisions 
Google Cloud Load Balancers for Pods in GKE clusters. 

The GKE Gateway controller supports weighted traffic splitting, mirroring, 
advanced routing, multi-cluster load balancing and more. See the docs to deploy 
[private or public Gateways][gke-gateway-deploy] and also [multi-cluster Gateways][gke-multi-cluster-gateway].

### HAProxy Ingress

[HAProxy Ingress][h1] is a community driven ingress controller implementation for HAProxy.

HAProxy Ingress v0.13 partially supports the Gateway API's v1alpha1 specification. See the [controller's Gateway API documentation][h2] to get informed about conformance and roadmap.

### Istio

[Istio][istio] is an open source [service mesh][mesh].

Istio is actively working towards an implementation of the Gateway API and you can use the [Istio Gateway API Documentation][istio-1] to deploy the Istio Gateway API in it's current state.

[istio-1]:https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/ingress/gateway-api/

### Kong

[Kong][kong] is an open source API Gateway built for hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

Kong is actively working towards an implementation of the Gateway API `v0.2.x` specification for it's [Kubernetes Ingress Controller][kic] and status updates and documentation will be provided here as the work progresses.

You can subscribe to [kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/692][kong-1] to track the implementation progress and [contribute][kong-2]!

### Traefik

[Traefik][traefik] is an open source cloud-native application proxy.

Traefik currently supports the previous `v0.1.x` Gateway API specification, check the [Kubernetes Gateway Documentation][traefik-1] for information on how to deploy and use Traefik's Gateway implementation.

Traefik is currently working on implementing TCP, status updates and documentation will be provided here as the work progresses.
