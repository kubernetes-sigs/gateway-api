# Introduction

Gateway API is an official Kubernetes project focused on L4 and L7 routing in
Kubernetes. This project represents the next generation of Kubernetes Ingress,
Load Balancing, and Service Mesh APIs. From the outset, it has been designed to
be generic, expressive, and role-oriented.

The overall resource model focuses on 3 separate
[personas](/concepts/roles-and-personas) and corresponding resources that
they are expected to manage:

Most of the configuration in this API is contained in the Routing layer. These
protocol-specific resources ([HTTPRoute](/api-types/httproute),
[GRPCRoute](/api-types/grpcroute), etc) enable advanced routing capabilities
for both Ingress and Mesh.

The Gateway API Logo helps illustrate the dual purpose of this API, enabling
routing for both North-South (Ingress) and East-West (Mesh) traffic to share the
same configuration.

## Gateway API for Ingress <a name="for-ingress"></a>

??? success "Standard in v0.5.0+"

    Gateway, GatewayClass, and HTTPRoute have been part of the Standard Channel
    of Gateway API since v0.5.0 and are considered stable APIs. For more
    information refer to our [versioning guide](/concepts/versioning).

When using Gateway API to manage ingress traffic, the [Gateway](/api-types/gateway) resource
defines a point of access at which traffic can be routed across multiple
contexts -- for example, from outside the cluster to inside the cluster
([north/south traffic]).

Each Gateway is associated with a [GatewayClass](/api-types/gatewayclass), which
describes the actual kind of [gateway controller] that will handle traffic for
the Gateway; individual routing resources (such as
[HTTPRoute](/api-types/httproute)) are then [associated with the Gateway
resources][gateway-attachment]. Separating these different concerns into
distinct resources is a critical part of the role-oriented nature of Gateway
API, as well as allowing for multiple kinds of gateway controllers (represented
by GatewayClass resources), each with multiple instances (represented by Gateway
resources), in the same cluster.

## Gateway API for Service Mesh (the [GAMMA initiative](/mesh/gamma)) <a name="for-service-mesh"></a>

??? example "Standard in v1.2.0+"

    The [GAMMA initiative](/mesh/gamma) work for supporting service mesh use cases
    is part of the Standard Channel of Gateway API since v1.2.0 and are considered stable APIs. For more
    information refer to our [versioning guide](/concepts/versioning).

Things are a bit different when using Gateway API to manage a [service
mesh][service-mesh]. Since there will usually only be one mesh active in the
cluster, the [Gateway](/api-types/gateway) and
[GatewayClass](/api-types/gatewayclass) resources are not used; instead,
individual route resources (such as [HTTPRoute](/api-types/httproute)) are
[associated directly with Service resources][mesh-attachment], permitting the
mesh to manage traffic from any traffic directed to that Service while
preserving the role-oriented nature of Gateway API.

To date, [GAMMA](/mesh/gamma) has been able to support mesh functionality with
fairly minimal changes to Gateway API. One particular area that has
rapidly become critical for GAMMA, though, is the definition of the different
[facets of the Service resource][service-facets].

## Getting started

Whether you are a user interested in using Gateway API or an implementer
interested in conforming to the API, the following resources will help give
you the necessary background:

- [API overview](/concepts/api-overview)
- [User guides](/guides)
- [Implementations](/implementations)
- [API reference spec](/reference/spec)
- [Community links](/contributing/community) and [developer guide](/contributing/devguide)

## Gateway API concepts
The following design goals drive the concepts of Gateway API. These
demonstrate how Gateway aims to improve upon current standards like Ingress.

- **Role-oriented** - Gateway is composed of API resources which model
organizational roles that use and configure Kubernetes service networking.
- **Portable** - This isn't an improvement but rather something
that should stay the same. Just as Ingress is a universal specification with
[numerous implementations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/),
Gateway API is designed to be a portable specification supported by many
implementations.
- **Expressive** - Gateway API resources support core functionality for things
like header-based matching, traffic weighting, and other capabilities that
were only possible in Ingress through custom annotations.
- **Extensible** - Gateway API allows for custom resources to be linked at
various layers of the API. This makes granular customization possible at the
appropriate places within the API structure.

Some other notable capabilities include:

- **GatewayClasses** - GatewayClasses formalize types of load balancing
implementations. These classes make it easy and explicit for users to
understand what kind of capabilities are available via the Kubernetes resource
model.
- **Shared Gateways and cross-Namespace support** - They allow the sharing of
load balancers and VIPs by permitting independent Route resources to attach to
the same Gateway. This allows teams (even across Namespaces) to share
infrastructure safely without direct coordination.
- **Typed Routes and typed backends** - Gateway API supports typed Route
resources and also different types of backends. This allows the API to be
flexible in supporting various protocols (like HTTP and gRPC) and
various backend targets (like Kubernetes Services, storage buckets, or
functions).
- Experimental **Service mesh support** with the [GAMMA initiative][gamma] -
Gateway API supports associating routing resources with Service resources,
to configure service meshes as well as ingress controllers.

## Why does a role-oriented API matter?

Whether itâ€™s roads, power, data centers, or Kubernetes clusters,
infrastructure is built to be shared. However, shared infrastructure raises a
common challenge - how to provide flexibility to users of the infrastructure
while maintaining control by owners of the infrastructure?

Gateway API accomplishes this through a role-oriented design for
Kubernetes service networking that strikes a balance between distributed
flexibility and centralized control. It allows shared network infrastructure
(hardware load balancers, cloud networking, cluster-hosted proxies etc) to be
used by many different and non-coordinating teams, all bound by the policies
and constraints set by cluster operators.

The roles used for Gateway API's design are defined by three personas:

### Personas

- **Ian** (he/him) is an _infrastructure provider_. His role is the care and
  feeding of a set of infrastructure that permits multiple isolated clusters
  to serve multiple tenants. He is not beholden to any single tenant; rather,
  he worries about all of them collectively.

- **Chihiro** (they/them) is a _cluster operator_. Their role is to manage a
  single cluster, ensuring that it meets the needs of its several users.
  Again, Chihiro is beholden to no single user of their cluster; they need to
  make sure that the cluster serves all of them as needed.

- **Ana** (she/her) is an _application developer_. Ana is in a unique position
  among the Gateway API roles: her focus is on the business needs her
  application is meant to serve, _not_ Kubernetes or Gateway API. In fact,
  Ana is likely to view Gateway API and Kubernetes as pure friction
  getting in her way to get things done.

(These three are discussed in more detail in [Roles and
Personas](/concepts/roles-and-personas).)

It should be clear that while Ana, Chihiro, and Ian do not necessarily see
eye-to-eye about everything, they need to work together to keep things running
smoothly. This is the core challenge of Gateway API in a nutshell.

### Use Cases

The [example use cases][use-cases] show this role-oriented model at work. Its
flexibility allows the API to adapt to vastly different organizational models
and implementations while remaining a portable and standard API.

The use cases presented are deliberately cast in terms of the roles presented
above. Ultimately Gateway API is meant for use by humans, which means that
it must fit the uses to which each of Ana, Chihiro, and Ian will put it.

## What's the difference between Gateway API and an API Gateway?

An API Gateway is a general concept that describes anything that exposes
capabilities of a backend service, while providing extra capabilities for
traffic routing and manipulation, such as load balancing, request and response
transformation, and sometimes more advanced features like authentication and
authorization, rate limiting, and circuit breaking.

Gateway API is an interface, or set of resources, that model service
networking in Kubernetes. One of the main resources is a `Gateway`, which
declares the Gateway type (or class) to instantiate and its configuration. As
a Gateway Provider, you can implement Gateway API to model Kubernetes
service networking in an expressive, extensible, and role-oriented way.

Most Gateway API implementations are API Gateways to some extent, but not all
API Gateways are Gateway API implementations.

## Who is working on Gateway API?

Gateway API is a
[SIG-Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network)
project being built to improve and standardize service networking in Kubernetes.
