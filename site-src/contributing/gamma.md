# The GAMMA Initiative

The GAMMA (Gateway API for Mesh Management and Administration) initiative is a dedicated workstream within the Gateway API subproject. This group’s goal is to investigate, design, and track Gateway API resources, semantics, and other artifacts related to service mesh technology and use-cases. Additionally, we strive to advocate for consistency between implementations of the Gateway API by service mesh projects, regardless of their technology stack or proxy.

## Deliverables

This group will deliver [gateway enhancement proposals](/contributing/gep) consisting of resources, additions, and modifications to the Gateway API specification for mesh and mesh-adjacent use-cases. Governance of the Gateway API specification remains solely with the maintainers of the Gateway API subproject. Ideally, once service mesh use-cases become a first-party concern of the spec, there will be no further need for a separate initiative.

## Meeting mechanics

GAMMA meetings will occur weekly on Tuesdays for 1 hour, alternating between morning and afternoon time slots to try to be as time-zone inclusive as possible. Meetings will be moderated by the co-chairs with notes taken by a volunteer. Meeting occurences can be found on the [sig-network calendar](/contributing/community/#meetings). Community members should feel free to attend both GAMMA and Gateway API meetings, but are by no means obligated to do so.
