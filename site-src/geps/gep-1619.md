# GEP-1619: Session Persistence and Session Affinity

* Issue: [#1619](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1619)
* Status: Provisional

(See definitions in [GEP Status][/contributing/gep#status].)

## TLDR

This GEP proposes a definition of session persistence and session affinity as the foundation of future session persistence related improvements. This GEP also outlines the ways session persistence could be achieved by implementations.

## Goals
- Define session persistence and session affinity to establish a common language
- Identify differences in session persistence functionality between implementations

## Non-Goals
- Mandate a default or expected session persistence functionality for implementations

## Introduction

### Defining Session Persistence

Session persistence is when a client request is directed to the same backend server for the duration of a "session". It is achieved when a client directly provides information, such as a header, that a proxy uses as a reference to direct traffic to a specific server. Persistence is an exception to load balancing: a persistent client request bypasses the proxy's load balancing algorithm, going directly to a backend server it has previously established a session with.

Session persistence enables more efficient application workflows:
1. Better performance: Maintaining a single session allows a server to cache information about a client locally reducing the need for servers to exchange session data and overall storage needs.
2. Seamless client experience: Clients can reconnect to the same server without re-authenticating or re-entering their information.

Some of the concerns of session persistence are the duration and expiration of the session, security of the transaction stream, and storage of the context or state. 

Session affinity, not to be confused with session persistence, uses an existing attribute of the request to consistently send to the same backend. Session affinity can be considered a weaker form of session persistence: it is not guaranteed to persist a connection to the same backend server if certain attributes of the request or the backends are changed.

### Security and Privacy Implications

Session persistence can introduce security and privacy vulnerabilities if not properly implemented. These vulnerabilities can include:

1. Session hijacking: Attackers intercepting or predicting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access.
2. Session fixation: Attackers setting a client's session ID to a known value, which they can then use to hijack the session.
3. Session replay attacks: Attackers capturing and resending a client's message with a valid session ID.
4. Data leakage: Attackers can exploit sensitive session information cached on servers if not properly secured.
5. Denial of service attacks: Attackers can use up server resources by creating and maintaining large numbers of sessions.

To mitigate these security concerns, it is important to implement session persistence using secure practices, such as using strong session ID generation algorithms, implementing session timeouts, encrypting sensitive data, and monitoring server resources for unusual activity.

Session affinity introduces fewer security and privacy vulnerabilities since there are no session tokens to protect or exploit.

### Achieving Session Persistence

Session persistence is achieved using attributes residing in the application layer. The following are mechanisms for achieving session persistence:

**1. Cookie-Based Session Persistence**

The most common mechanism is by using cookies (described by [RFC6265](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6265)) with the set-cookie HTTP response header. A client will use the provided value in the set-cookie response header in a cookie request header in subsequent requests. Proxies can use this cookie header to maintain a persistent connection to a single backend server on behalf of the client.

**2. Header-Based Session Persistence**

Header-based stateful sessions are achieved by a backend or gateway providing an HTTP response header and the client using the same header in subsequent HTTP requests. Proxies can use this header to maintain a persistent connection to a single backend server on behalf of the client.

**3. URL-Encoded Session Persistence**

Session information can be also encoded into the request URL to establish a persistent session. The server rewrites the client's URL to encode the new session information automatically. The server then decodes the session information from the URL to identify the session.

**Session Initiation**

For both header-based and cookie-based sessions, either the gateway or the backend server can initiate establishing the session via the appropriate header or set-cookie attributes. The following rules apply based on who initiates the session:

- If the backend initiates the session, the gateway should allow this and not force persistence connections, unless specifically configured to. The gateway may decode and alter the cookie established by the backend to achieve session persistence.
- If the gateway initiates the session, the backend will be presented with session attributes regardless if it enabled them. 

### Achieving Session Affinity

While session persistence uses attributes in the application layer, session affinity often uses, but is not limited to, attributes below the application layer.

Session affinity can be achieved by deterministic load balancing algorithms or a proxy feature that tracks IP-to-backend associations such as [HAProxy's stick tables](https://www.haproxy.com/blog/introduction-to-haproxy-stick-tables/) or [Cilium's session affinity](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.12/gettingstarted/kubeproxy-free/#id2). 

### Implementations
To help understand the scope of session persistence and session affinity, we've created a table describing how each implementation achieves it. Input from implementations is appreciated to complete this table.

### Sessions in Java

Java application servers such as Tomcat and Jetty, were the first to standardize the API around persistent sessions. These Java applications introduced the “jsessionid” cookie as well as more advanced features such as session migration, replication, and on demand session activation. It’s important for Gateway API to examine persistent session use cases and history from Java APIs to ensure the API is designed appropriately.

### Open Questions

TBD

## TODO
The following are items that we intend to resolve before we consider this GEP implementable:

- We need to identify the needs and use cases from end users for specifying session persistence.
- We need to identify and document requirements regarding session draining and migration. How do implementations drain established sessions during backend upgrades without disruption?
- We need to document sessions with Java in greater detail. Java standardized the API and behavior of session persistence long ago and would be worth examining.
- We need to add a small section on compliance regarding the browser and client relationship.
- We need to design and document an API for session persistence and/or session affinity in the Gateway API spec.

## API

TBD

## Alternatives

### Alternate Naming

This GEP describes session persistence and session affinity as the idea of strong and weak connection persistence respectively. Other technologies use different names or define persistence and affinity differently:

- Envoy defines [stateful sessions](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/http/stateful_session/cookie/v3/cookie.proto) as what we've defined as session persistence
- Google Cloud defines [session affinity](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/session-affinity) as what we've defined as session persistence
- Nginx defines [session persistence](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/load-balancer/http-load-balancer/#enabling-session-persistence) as what we've defined as both session persistence and affinity
- Traefik defines [sticky sessions](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/services/#sticky-sessions) as what we've defined as session persistence
- Apache httpd defines [sticky sessions or stickyness](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html) as what we've defined as session persistence

Though session persistence is a ubiquitous name, session affinity is more inconsistently used. An alternate decision could be made to use a different name for session affinity based on the prevalence of other naming conventions.
