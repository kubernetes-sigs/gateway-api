## TLDR

(1-2 sentence summary of the proposal)

## Motivation/User Journeys/Background

(Can link to external doc -- but we should bias towards copying
the content into the GEP as online documents are easier to lose
-- e.g. owner messes up the permissions, accidental deletion)

## API

(... details, can point to PR with changes)


## Alternatives

(List other design alternatives and why we did not go in that
direction)

## Out of scope

(What is out of scope for this proposal.)

## References

(Add any additional document links. Again, we should try to avoid
too much content not in version control to avoid broken links)
