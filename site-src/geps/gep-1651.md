# GEP-1651: Cluster Local Gateways

* Issue: [#1651](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1651)
* Status: Provisional

(See status definitions [here](overview.md#status).)

## TLDR

Allow users to configure a Gateway and it's attached Routes to not
be exposed externally.

## Goals

- Allow Gateway and Routes to be configured directly to not be exposed externally

## Non-Goals

- Determining 'visibility' on a per-request basis
- Not a lightweight service mesh

## Introduction

One of the early feature requests for Knative was the ability to deploy an application using Knative's HTTP routing support, but make it only available within the cluster. I want to be able to specify both the "internal" (service.namespace.svc) and "external" (service.namespace.example.com) Gateways using the same GatewayClass on the cluster, but ensure that the "internal" service is only reachable within the cluster. This would greatly simplify deployment for users over the instructions we have today.

The reason why we require an "internal" Gateway is so we can take advantage of layer 7 load balancing for our internal services.
