# GEP-718: Rework forwardTo segment in routes

* Issue: [#718](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/718)
* Status: Standard

## Motivation

### Complications due to the `serviceName` shortcut

Within `RouteForwardTo` (and `HTTPRouteForwardTo` by extension) there exists
two mechanisms to specify the upstream network endpoint where the traffic should
be forwarded to:
- `ServiceName`: the name of the Kubernetes Service
- `BackendRef`: a LocalObjectReference to a resource, this is an extension point in the API

While working on [#685](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685),
it came to light that:
1. `BackendRef` itself could be used to point to a Kubernetes Service
2. With [GEP-709](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/711),
there will be a need to introduce a new `namespace` field which will enable use-cases to forward
traffic to a services and backends located in different namespaces

While (1) can be fixed with more validation and documentation, it only solves for
the specific case. (2) requires adding two fields: `serviceNamespace`
and `BackendRef.Namespace` - something we would like to avoid since the `serviceName`
field was introduced only as a shortcut and adding more service-specific fields
defeats the original purpose.

These problems are in addition to the original problem that
[#685](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685) attempts to solve:
clarifying port requirements when a port is required or not.
We have been updating documentation to tackle such corner-cases but that
continues to result in more and more elaborations. Some excerpts from our
existing documentation:
```
	// ServiceName refers to the name of the Service to mirror matched requests
	// to. When specified, this takes the place of BackendRef. If both
	// BackendRef and ServiceName are specified, ServiceName will be given
	// precedence.

	// BackendRef is a local object reference to mirror matched requests to. If
	// both BackendRef and ServiceName are specified, ServiceName will be given
	// precedence.

	// Weight specifies the proportion of HTTP requests forwarded to the backend
	// referenced by the ServiceName or BackendRef field. This is computed as

	// Port specifies the destination port number to use for the
	// backend referenced by the ServiceName or BackendRef field.
	// If unspecified, the destination port in the request is used
	// when forwarding to a backendRef or serviceName.
```

### Simplifying `RouteForwardTo`

RouteForwardTo is not the best of the names. Using a noun instead of a verb
would help with in-person communication and documentation.
Since we are already considering dropping the special case of `service` as a
backend, we have an opportunity to further simplify `RouteForwardTo` for better
UX.

## Proposal

- Remove the `ServiceName` field from `RouteForwardTo`
- Introduce `Service` as a default for `BackendRef.Kind`
- Pull fields from `RouteForwardTo.BackendRef` into `RouteForwardTo` itself
- Rename `RouteForwardTo` to `BackendRef`
- Rename `Route.Spec.Rules[].ForwardTo[]` to `Route.Spec.Rules[].BackendRefs[]` in
  all routes
- Apply the same to HTTP types and filters

## API

The updated `BackendRef` (formerly `RouteForwardTo`) struct will be:
(HTTP version has been omitted for brevity)

```go
// BackendRef defines how and where a request should be forwarded from the Gateway.
type BackendRef struct {
	// Group is the group of the backend resource.
	//
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
	Group string `json:"group"`

	// Kind is kind of the backend resource.
	//
	// Support: Core (Kubernetes Service)
	// Support: Implementation-specific (any other resource)
	//
	// +optional
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
	// +kubebuilder:default="service"
	Kind *string `json:"kind"`

	// Name is the name of the backend resource to forward matched requests to.
	//
	// If the referent cannot be found, the rule is not included in the route.
	// The controller should raise the "ResolvedRefs" condition on the Gateway
	// with the "DegradedRoutes" reason. The gateway status for this route should
	// be updated with a condition that describes the error more specifically.
	//
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// Port specifies the destination port number to use for the
	// backend resource.
	// This field is required when the backend is a Kubernetes Service.
	//
	// Support: Core
	//
	// +optional
	Port *PortNumber `json:"port,omitempty"`

	// Weight specifies the proportion of HTTP requests forwarded to the backend
	// This is computed as weight/(sum of all weights in this Backends list).
	// For non-zero values, there may be some epsilon from the exact proportion
	// defined here depending on the precision an implementation supports. Weight
	// is not a percentage and the sum of weights does not need to equal 100.
	//
	// If only one backend is specified and it has a weight greater than 0, 100%
	// of the traffic is forwarded to that backend. If weight is set to 0, no
	// traffic should be forwarded for this entry. If unspecified, weight
	// defaults to 1.
	//
	// Support: Extended
	//
	// +optional
	// +kubebuilder:default=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Minimum=0
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Maximum=1000000
	Weight *int32 `json:"weight,omitempty"`
}
```

## Examples


For Kubernetes Services, an updated `forwardTo` section will read as follows:

```yaml
...
backendRefs:
- name: foo-service-v1
  port: 80
  weight: 80
- name: foo-service-canary
  port: 80
  weight: 20
...
```

Here, the `kind` field is omitted as it will be injected as a default.

For custom backends, the API will look like the following:

```yaml
...
backendRefs:
- name: foo-v1
  kind: server
  group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 80
- name: foo-v1-canary
  kind: server
  group: networking.acme.io
  port: 80
  weight: 20
...
```

For completeness, here is an example of HTTPRoute:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: bar-route
  labels:
    gateway: prod-web-gw
spec:
  hostnames:
  - "bar.example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - headers:
        type: Exact
        values:
          env: canary
    backendRefs:
    - name: foo-service-v1
      port: 80
      weight: 80
    - name: foo-service-canary
      port: 80
      weight: 20
```

## Alternatives considered

### Rename serviceName to backendName

As suggested in [this comment](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/685#discussion_r667285837),
we could buy the best of both the worlds by introducing `backendName`:

```yaml
forwardTo:
- backendName: foo
  port: 80
    kind: <defaults to Service>
```

While this saves one line of YAML (`backendRef:`), it could be potentially
violating the `Naming of the reference field`
[API convention][api-convetions].
Most of our object references are of the form `XRef`.

## Concerns resolved

A concern was raised around flattening of object reference fields i.e. including
port and weight field alongside object reference is by k8s API conventions or not.
This is not a problem and has been confirmed with API maintainers
([comment](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/719#discussion_r678555744)).
