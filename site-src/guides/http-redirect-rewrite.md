# HTTP path redirects and rewrites

[HTTPRoute resources](/api-types/httproute) can issue redirects to
clients or rewrite paths sent upstream using
[filters](/api-types/httproute#filters-optional). This guide shows how
to use these features.

Note that redirect and rewrite filters are mutually incompatible. Rules cannot
use both filter types at once.

## Redirects

Redirects return HTTP 3XX responses to a client, instructing it to retrieve a
different resource. [`RequestRedirect` rule
filters](/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRequestRedirectFilter)
instruct Gateways to emit a redirect response to requests matching a filtered
HTTPRoute rule.

Redirect filters can substitute various URL components independently. For
example, to issue a permanent redirect (301) from HTTP to HTTPS, configure
`requestRedirect.statusCode=301` and `requestRedirect.scheme="https"`:

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-redirect-http.yaml' %}
```

Redirects change configured URL components to match the redirect configuration
while preserving other components from the original request URL. In this
example, the request `GET http://redirect.example/cinnamon` will result in a
301 response with a `location: https://redirect.example/cinnamon` header. The
hostname (`redirect.example`), path (`/cinnamon`), and port (implicit) remain
unchanged.

### HTTP-to-HTTPS redirects

To redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, you need to have a Gateway with both HTTP
and HTTPS listeners.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/gateway-redirect-http-https.yaml' %}
```
There are multiple ways to secure a Gateway. In this example, it is secured
using a Kubernetes Secret(`redirect-example` in the `certificateRefs` section).

You need a HTTPRoute that attaches to the HTTP listener and does the redirect
to HTTPS. Here we set `sectionName` to be `http` so it only selects the
listener named `http`.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-redirect-http.yaml' %}
```

You also need a HTTPRoute that attaches to the HTTPS listener that forwards
HTTPS traffic to application backends.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-redirect-https.yaml' %}
```

### Path redirects

Path redirects use an HTTP Path Modifier to replace either entire paths or path
prefixes. For example, the HTTPRoute below will issue a 302 redirect to all
`redirect.example` requests whose path begins with `/cayenne` to `/paprika`:

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-redirect-full.yaml' %}
```

Both requests to
`https://redirect.example/cayenne/pinch` and
`https://redirect.example/cayenne/teaspoon` will receive a redirect with a
`location: https://redirect.example/paprika`.

The other path redirect type, `ReplacePrefixMatch`, replaces only the path
portion matching `matches.path.value`. Changing the filter in the above to:

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-redirect-prefix.yaml' %}
```

will result in redirects with `location:
https://redirect.example/paprika/pinch` and `location:
https://redirect.example/paprika/teaspoon` response headers.

## Rewrites

Rewrites modify components of a client request before proxying it upstream. A
[`URLRewrite`
filter](/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPURLRewriteFilter)
can change the upstream request hostname and/or path. For example, the
following HTTPRoute will accept a request for
`https://rewrite.example/cardamom` and send it upstream to `example-svc` with
`host: elsewhere.example` in request headers instead of `host:
rewrite.example`.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-rewrite.yaml' %}
```

Path rewrites also make use of HTTP Path Modifiers. The HTTPRoute below
will take request for `https://rewrite.example/cardamom/smidgen` and proxy a
request to `https://elsewhere.example/fennel` upstream to `example-svc`.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-rewrite-full-path.yaml' %}
```

Instead using `type: ReplacePrefixMatch` and `replacePrefixMatch: /fennel` will
request `https://elsewhere.example/fennel/smidgen` upstream.

```yaml
{% include 'standard/http-redirect-rewrite/httproute-rewrite-prefix-path.yaml' %}
```
