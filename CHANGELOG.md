## v0.4.0-rc1

API version: v1alpha2

The working group expects that this release candidate is quite close to the final
v1alpha2 API. However, breaking API changes are still possible.

This release candidate is suitable for implementors, but the working group does
not recommend shipping products based on a release candidate API due to the
possibility of incompatible changes prior to the final release.

### Major Changes

* The Gateway API APIGroup has moved from `networking.x-k8s.io` to
`gateway.networking.k8s.io`. This means that, as far as the apiserver is
concerned, this version is wholly distinct from v1alpha1, and automatic conversion
is not possible. As part of this process, Gateway API is now subject to Kubernetes
API review, the same as changes made to core API resources. More details in
[#780](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/780) and [#716](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/716).

* Gateway-Route binding changes:
[GEP-724](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-724/). Currently, Gateways
choose which Routes are attached using a combination of object and namespace
selectors, with the option of also specifying object names. This has made a very
complex config, that's easy to misinterpret. As part of v1alpha2, we're changing to:
  * Gateways *may* specify what kind of Routes they support (defaults to same
  protocol if not specified), and where those Routes can be (defaults to same
  namespace).
  * Routes *must* directly reference the Gateways the want to attach to, this is
  a list, so a Route can attach to more than one Gateway.
  * The Route becomes attached only when the specifications intersect.
  
  We believe this is quite a bit easier to understand, and still gives good
  flexibility for most use cases.
  GEP added in [#725](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/725).
  Implemented in [#754](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/754).
  Further documentation was added in [#762](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/762).


* Safer cross-namespace references:
([GEP-709](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-709/)): This concerns
(currently), references from Routes to Backends, and Gateways to Secrets. The
new behavior is:
  * By default, references across namespaces are not permitted; creating a
  reference across a namespace (like a Route referencing a Service in another
  namespace) must be rejected by implementations.
  * These references can be accepted by creating a ReferencePolicy in the
  referent (target) namespace, that specifies what Kind is allowed to accept
  incoming references, and from what namespace and Kind the references may be.

  The intent here is that the owner of the referent namespace must explicitly
  accept incoming references, otherwise we can run into all sorts of bad things
  from breaking the namespace security model.
  Implemented in [#741](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/741).

* Attaching Policy to objects:
[GEP-713](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-713/): This has been added
so that we have an extensible mechanism for adding a cascading set of policy to
Gateway API objects.

  What policy? Well, it's kind of up to the implementations, but the best example
  to begin with is timeout policy.
  
  Timeout policy for HTTP connections is highly depedent on how the underlying
  implementation handles policy - it's very difficult to extract commonalities.

  This is intended to allow things like:
  * Attach a policy that specifies the default connection timeout for backends
  to a GatewayClass. All Gateways that are part of that Class will have Routes
  get that default connection timeout unless they specify differently.
  * If a Gateway that's a member of the GatewayClass has a different default
  attached, then that will beat the GatewayClass (for defaults, more specific
  object beats less specific object).
  * Alternatively, a Policy that mandates that you can't set the client timeout
  to "no timeout" can be attached to a GatewayClass as an override. An override
  will always take effect, with less specific beating more specific.

  This one is a bit complex, but will allow implementations to solve some things
  that currently require tools like admission control.
  Implemented in [#736](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/736).
  
* As part of GEP-713, `BackendPolicy` has been removed, as its functionality is
now better handled using that mechanism. [#732](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/732). 

* Removal of certificate references from HTTPRoutes:
[GEP-746](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-746/):
  In v1alpha1, HTTPRoute objects have a stanza that allows referencing a TLS
  keypair, intended to allow people to have a more self-service model, where an
  app owner can provision a TLS keypair inside their own namespace, attach it to
  a HTTPRoute they control, and then have that used to secure their app.
  When implementing this, however, there are a large number of edge cases that
  are complex, hard to handle, and poorly defined - about checking SNI, hostname,
  and overrides, that made even writing a spec on how to implement this very
  difficult, let alone actually implementing it.

  In removing certificate references from HTTPRoute, we're using the
  ReferencePolicy from GEP-709 to allow Gateways to securely create a
  cross-namespace reference to TLS keypairs in app namespaces.
  We're hopeful that this will hit most of the self-service use case, and even
  if not, provide a basis to build from to meet it eventually.
  GEP added in [#749](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/749).
  Implemented in [#768](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/768).

* The `RouteForwardTo` (YAML: `routeForwardTo`) struct/stanza has been reworked
into the `BackendRef` (YAML: `backendRef`) struct/stanza,
[GEP-718](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-718/). As part of this change,
the `ServiceName` (YAML: `serviceName`) field has been removed, and Service
references must instead now use the `BackendRef`/`backendRef` struct/stanza.

### Other changes
* HTTP Method matching is now added into HTTPRoute, with Extended support:
[#733](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/733).

* GatewayClass now has a 'Description' field that is printed as a column in
`kubectl get` output. You can now end up with output that looks like this:
  ```shell
  $> kubectl get gatewayclass
  NAME       CONTROLLER                            DESCRIPTION
  internal   gateway-controller-internal   For non-internet-facing Gateways.
  external   gateway-controller-external   For internet-facing Gateways.
  ```
  See [#610](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/610) and
  [#653](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/653) for the details.
  
*  [#671](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/671): Controller is
now a required field in Gateway references from Route status. Fixes
[#669](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/671).

*  [#657](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/657): and
[#681](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/681) Header Matching,
Query Param Matching, and HTTPRequestHeaderFilter now use named subobjects
instead of maps. 

* [#796](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/796) API Review suggestions:
  * listener.routes has been renamed to listener.allowedRoutes
  * The `NoSuchGatewayClass` has been removed after it was deprecated in v1alpha1
  * `*` is no longer a valid hostname. Instead, leaving hostname unspecified is interpreted as `*`.
