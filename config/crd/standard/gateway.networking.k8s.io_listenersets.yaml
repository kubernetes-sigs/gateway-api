          ListenerSet defines a set of additional listeners to attach to an existing Gateway.
          This resource provides a mechanism to merge multiple listeners into a single Gateway.

          The parent Gateway must explicitly allow ListenerSet attachment through its
          AllowedListeners configuration. By default, Gateways do not allow ListenerSet
          attachment.

          Routes can attach to a ListenerSet by specifying it as a parentRef, and can
          optionally target specific listeners using the sectionName field.

          Policy Attachment:
          - Policies that attach to a ListenerSet apply to all listeners defined in that resource
          - Policies do not impact listeners in the parent Gateway
          - Different ListenerSets attached to the same Gateway can have different policies
          - If an implementation cannot apply a policy to specific listeners, it should reject the policy

          ReferenceGrant Semantics:
          - ReferenceGrants applied to a Gateway are not inherited by child ListenerSets
          - ReferenceGrants applied to a ListenerSet do not grant permission to the parent Gateway's listeners
          - A ListenerSet can reference secrets/backends in its own namespace without a ReferenceGrant

          Gateway Integration:
            - The parent Gateway's status will include "AttachedListenerSets"
              which is the count of ListenerSets that have successfully attached to a Gateway
              A ListenerSet is successfully attached to a Gateway when all the following conditions are met:
            - The ListenerSet is selected by the Gateway's AllowedListeners field
            - The ListenerSet has a valid ParentRef selecting the Gateway
            - The ListenerSet's status has the condition "Accepted: true"

                description: |-
                  Listeners associated with this ListenerSet. Listeners define
                  logical endpoints that are bound on this referenced parent Gateway's addresses.

                  Listeners in a `Gateway` and their attached `ListenerSets` are concatenated
                  as a list when programming the underlying infrastructure. Each listener
                  name does not need to be unique across the Gateway and ListenerSets.
                  See ListenerEntry.Name for more details.

                  Implementations MUST treat the parent Gateway as having the merged
                  list of all listeners from itself and attached ListenerSets using
                  the following precedence:

                  1. "parent" Gateway
                  2. ListenerSet ordered by creation time (oldest first)
                  3. ListenerSet ordered alphabetically by "{namespace}/{name}".

                  An implementation MAY reject listeners by setting the ListenerEntryStatus
                  `Accepted` condition to False with the Reason `TooManyListeners`

                  If a listener has a conflict, this will be reported in the
                  Status.ListenerEntryStatus setting the `Conflicted` condition to True.

                  Implementations SHOULD be cautious about what information from the
                  parent or siblings are reported to avoid accidentally leaking
                  sensitive information that the child would not otherwise have access
                  to. This can include contents of secrets etc.

                        AllowedRoutes defines the types of routes that MAY be attached to a
                        Listener and the trusted namespaces where those Route resources MAY be
                        present.

                        Although a client request may match multiple route rules, only one rule
                        may ultimately receive the request. Matching precedence MUST be
                        determined in order of the following criteria:

                        * The most specific match as defined by the Route type.
                        * The oldest Route based on creation timestamp. For example, a Route with
                          a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:03" is given precedence over
                          a Route with a creation timestamp of "2020-09-08 01:02:04".
                        * If everything else is equivalent, the Route appearing first in
                          alphabetical order (namespace/name) should be given precedence. For
                          example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

                        All valid rules within a Route attached to this Listener should be
                        implemented. Invalid Route rules can be ignored (sometimes that will mean
                        the full Route). If a Route rule transitions from valid to invalid,
                        support for that Route rule should be dropped to ensure consistency. For
                        example, even if a filter specified by a Route rule is invalid, the rest
                        of the rules within that Route should still be supported.

                        field is ignored for protocols that don't require hostname based
                        matching.

                        Implementations MUST apply Hostname matching appropriately for each of
                        the following protocols:

                        * TLS: The Listener Hostname MUST match the SNI.
                        * HTTP: The Listener Hostname MUST match the Host header of the request.
                        * HTTPS: The Listener Hostname SHOULD match at both the TLS and HTTP
                          protocol layers as described above. If an implementation does not
                          ensure that both the SNI and Host header match the Listener hostname,
                          it MUST clearly document that.

                        For HTTPRoute and TLSRoute resources, there is an interaction with the
                        `spec.hostnames` array. When both listener and route specify hostnames,
                        there MUST be an intersection between the values for a Route to be
                        accepted. For more information, refer to the Route specific Hostnames
                        documentation.

                        Hostnames that are prefixed with a wildcard label (`*.`) are interpreted
                        as a suffix match. That means that a match for `*.example.com` would match
                        both `test.example.com`, and `foo.test.example.com`, but not `example.com`.

                  Conditions describe the current conditions of the ListenerSet.

                  Implementations MUST express ListenerSet conditions using the
                  `ListenerSetConditionType` and `ListenerSetConditionReason`
                  constants so that operators and tools can converge on a common
                  vocabulary to describe ListenerSet state.

                  Known condition types are:

                  * "Accepted"

                        successfully attached to this Listener.

                        Successful attachment of a Route to a Listener is based solely on the
                        combination of the AllowedRoutes field on the corresponding Listener
                        and the Route's ParentRefs field. A Route is successfully attached to
                        a Listener when it is selected by the Listener's AllowedRoutes field
                        AND the Route has a valid ParentRef selecting the whole Gateway
                        resource or a specific Listener as a parent resource (more detail on
                        attachment semantics can be found in the documentation on the various
                        Route kinds ParentRefs fields). Listener status does not impact
                        successful attachment, i.e. the AttachedRoutes field count MUST be set
                        for Listeners, even if the Accepted condition of an individual Listener is set
                        to "False". The AttachedRoutes number represents the number of Routes with
                        the Accepted condition set to "True" that have been attached to this Listener.
                        Routes with any other value for the Accepted condition MUST NOT be included
                        in this count.

                        Uses for this field include troubleshooting Route attachment and
                        measuring blast radius/impact of changes to a Listener.
