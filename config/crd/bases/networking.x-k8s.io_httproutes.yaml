If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on the HTTPRouteRules. \n Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \"foo.example.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.example.com\"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following order: 1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if    the http host header is equal to Host. 2.

If no hostname is specified, traffic is routed based on the HTTPRouteRules. \n Hostname can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \"foo.example.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.example.com\"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following order: 1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if    the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if    the http host header is to equal to the suffix    (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule. \n Support: Core"
