                  against the HTTP Host header to select a HTTPRoute to process the
                  request. Hostname is the fully qualified domain name of a network
                  host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from
                  the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in the RFC: \n 1. IPs are
                  not allowed. 2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports
                  are not allowed. \n Incoming requests are matched against the hostnames
                  before the HTTPRoute rules. If no hostname is specified, traffic
                  is routed based on the HTTPRouteRules. \n Requests will be matched
                  against the Host field in the following order: \n 1. If Hostname
                  is precise, the request matches this rule if    the HTTP Host header
                  is equal to the Hostname. 2. If Hostname is a wildcard, then the
                  request matches this rule if    the HTTP Host header is to equal
                  to the suffix    (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule.
                  3. If Hostname is unspecified, empty, or `*`, then any request will
                  match    this route. \n If a hostname is specified by the Listener
                  that the HTTPRoute is bound to, at least one hostname specified
                  here must match the Listener specified hostname as per the rules
                  above. Other hostnames will not affect processing of the route in
                  that case. \n If no hostname is specified by the Listener, then
                  that value will be treated as '*', match any hostname, and so any
                  hostname on this Route will match. \n If all hostnames do not match,
                  then the HTTPRoute is not admitted, and the implementation must
                  raise an 'Admitted' Condition with a status of `false` for that
                  Listener. \n Examples: - A Listener with unspecified, empty, or
                  `*` values for Hostname matches   any HTTPRoute hostname. - A HTTPRoute
                  with unspecified, empty, or `*` values for Hostname matches   any
                  Listener hostname. - A Listener with `test.foo.com` as the hostname
                  matches *only*   `test.foo.com` or `*.foo.com`. Any other hostnames
                  present must be ignored. - A Listener with `*.foo.com` as hostname,
                  all hostnames in the HTTPRoute   must have any single label where
                  the star is, and the rest of the hostname   must match exactly.
                  So, `test.foo.com`, `*.foo.com` or `blog.foo.com` match.   `test.blog.foo.com`,
                  `test.bar.com`, or `bar.com` do not. Hostnames that do   not match
                  will be ignored. \n Support: Core"

                        precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria,
                        continuing on ties: \n * The oldest Route based on creation
                        timestamp. For example, a Route with   a creation timestamp
                        of \"2020-09-08 01:02:03\" is given precedence over   a Route

                        Route appearing first in alphabetical order by   \"<namespace>/<name>\".
                        For example, foo/bar is given precedence over   foo/baz. \n
                        If ties still exist within the Route that has been given precedence,
                        matching precedence MUST be granted to the first matching
