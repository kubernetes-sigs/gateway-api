# GEP-1742: Timeouts

* Issue: [#1742](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1742)
* Status: Provisional

(See status definitions [here](overview.md#status).)

## TLDR

Create some sort of design so that Gateway API objects can be used to configure
timeouts for different types of connection.

## Goals

- Create some method to configure some timeouts
- Timeout config must be applicable to most if not all Gateway API implementations.

## Non-Goals

- TBD

## Introduction

In talking about Gateway API objects, particularly HTTPRoute, we've mentioned
timeout configuration many times in the past as "too hard" to find the common
ground necessary to make more generic configuration. This GEP intends firstly
to make this process less difficult, then to find common timeouts that we can
build into Gateway API.

For this initial round, we'll focus on Layer 7 HTTP traffic, while acknowledging
that Layer 4 connections have their own interesting timeouts as well.

The following sections will review all the implementations, then document what
timeouts are _available_ for the various data planes.

### Background on implementations

Most implementations that handle HTTPRoute objects use a proxy as the data plane
implementation, that actually forwards flows as directed by Gateway API configuration.

The following table is a review of all the listed implementations of Gateway API
at the time of writing, with the data plane they use for Layer 7, based on what information
could be found online. If there are errors here, or if the implementation doesn't
support layer 7, please feel free to correct them.

| Implementation | Data Plane       |
|----------------|------------|
| Acnodal EPIC   | Envoy      |
| Apache APISIX  | Nginx      |
| BIG-IP Kubernetes Gateway| F5 BIG-IP  |
| Cilium         | Envoy      |
| Contour        | Envoy      |
| Emissary Ingress| Envoy     |
| Envoy Gateway  | Envoy      |
| Flomesh Service Mesh | Pipy |
| Gloo Edge      | Envoy      |
| Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) | Similar to Envoy Timeouts |
| HAProxy Ingress | HAProxy   |
| Hashicorp Consul | Envoy    |
| Istio          | Envoy      |
| Kong           | Nginx      |
| Kuma           | Envoy      |
| Litespeed      | Litespeed WebADC |
| Nginx Kubernetes Gateway | Nginx |
| Traefik        | Traefik    |


### Flow diagrams with available timeouts

The following flow diagrams are based off the basic diagram below, with all the
timeouts I could find included.

In general, timeouts are recorded with the setting name or similar that the data
plane uses for them, and are correct as far as I've parsed the documentation
correctly.

Idle timeouts are marked as such.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant P as Proxy
    participant U as Upstream
    C->>P: Connection Started
    C->>P: Starts sending Request
    C->>P: Finishes Headers
    C->>P: Finishes request
    P->>U: Connection Started
    P->>U: Starts sending Request
    P->>U: Finishes request
    P->>U: Finishes Headers
    U->>P: Starts Response
    U->>P: Finishes Headers
    U->>P: Finishes Response
    P->>C: Starts Response
    P->>C: Finishes Headers
    P->>C: Finishes Response
    Note right of P: Repeat if connection sharing
    U->>C: Connection ended
```

#### Envoy Timeouts

For Envoy, some timeouts are configurable at either the HTTP Connection Manager
(very, very roughly equivalent to a Listener), the Route (equivalent to a HTTPRoute)
level, or the Cluster (usually close to the Service) or some combination. These
are noted in the below diagram with a `CM`, `R`, or `Cluster` prefix respectively.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant P as Envoy
    participant U as Upstream
    C->>P: Connection Started
    activate P
    Note left of P: transport_socket_connect_timeout for TLS
    deactivate P
    C->>P: Starts sending Request
    activate C
    activate P
    activate P
    C->>P: Finishes Headers

    deactivate C
    Note right of P: Repeat if connection sharing
    U->>C: Connection ended

```

#### Nginx timeouts

Nginx allows setting of GRPC and general HTTP timeouts separately, although the
purposes seem to be roughly equivalent.

    C->>P: Finishes request
    P->>U: Connection Started
    Activate U
	  Activate U
    P->>U: Starts sending Request
    activate U
    note left of U: proxy_connect_timeout<br/>grpc_connect_timeout
    deactivate U
    P->>U: Finishes Headers
		P->>U: Finishes request
    Note right of U: (between write operations)<br/>proxy_send_timeout<br/>grpc_send_timeout
    deactivate U
		activate U
    U->>P: Starts Response
    U->>P: Finishes Headers
        Note right of U: proxy_read_timeout<br/>grpc_read_timeout
    U->>P: Finishes Response
    deactivate U
    P->>C: Starts Response
    P->>C: Finishes Headers
    P->>C: Finishes Response
    Note right of P: Repeat if connection sharing
    Note Right of U: keepalive_timeout (if keepalive enabled)
    U->>C: Connection ended

```

## API

The above diagrams show that there are many different kinds of configurable timeouts
supported by Gateway implementations: connect, idle, request, upstream, downstream.
Although there may be opportunity for the specification of a common API for more of
them in the future, this GEP will focus on the L7 timeouts in HTTPRoutes that are
most valuable to clients.

From the above analysis, it appears that most implementations are capable of supporting
the configuration of simple downstream request timeouts on HTTPRoute rules. This is a
relatively small addition (one new field) that would benefit many users.

Because request timeouts are very much related to retry attempts, we also propose
addressing issue: [#1731](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1731)
by adding another field for retry conifguration in an HTTPRoute rule. This would also
benefit many users and seems to be implementable by many (most?) Gateway implementations.

### GO

```go
type HTTPRouteRule struct {
	// Timeout for HTTP requests, disabled by default.
	Timeout *time.Duration `json:"timeout,omitempty"`
	// Retry policy for HTTP requests.
	Retries *HTTPRetry `json:"retries,omitempty"`
	// ...
}

type HTTPRetry struct {
	// Number of retries to be allowed for a given request.
	Attempts int32 `json:"attempts,omitempty"`
	// Timeout per attempt for a given request, including the initial call and any retries.
	// Default is the value of the HTTPRouteRule request Timeout.
	PerTryTimeout *time.Duration `json:"perTryTimeout,omitempty"`
	// Specifies one or more conditions under which retry takes place.
	RetryOn []string `json:"retryOn,omitempty"`
	// Flag to specify whether the retries should retry to other localities.
	RetryRemoteLocalities *bool `json:"retryRemoteLocalities,omitempty"`
}
```

### YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: timeout-example
spec:
  ...
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - name: some-service
      port: 8080
    timeout: 10s
    retries:
      attempts: 3
      perTryTimeout: 2s
      retryOn: [ "503" ]
```

### Timeout values

Timeout and PerTryTimeout values are formatted as 1h/1m/1s/1ms and MUST BE >= 1ms.

### Retry attempts

By default, the number of retry attempts is implementation dependent. An implementation MAY
provide external mechanisims for controlling the default retry behavior.

When a request Timeout in the HTTPRouteRule or PerTryTimeout value is configured, the actual
number of retries attempted may be reduced depending on the specified request Timeout and
PerTryTimeout values.

An implementation MUST ensure that the number of retries never exceeds the Attempts value,
if specified.

The interval between retries is implementation dependent but SHOULD be a minimum of 25ms.

### RetryOn Conditions

The value of an individual RetryOn condition can be either an HTTP status codes (e.g., 503)
or some other identifier known to the implementation.

An implementation MUST support any HTTP status code value for a RetryOn condition.

The default conditions that will trigger retries, if no RetryOn conditions are specified,
is implementation dependent.

### RetryRemoteLocalities

When an implementation supports prioritizing endpoints based on their locations, this field
can be used to control whether or not retry attempts should only select endpoints with the
same priority (RetryRemoteLocalities=false) or any healthy endpoint, regardless of location
(RetryRemoteLocalities=true).
