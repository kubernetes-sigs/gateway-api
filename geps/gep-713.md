## TLDR

This GEP aims to standardize terminology and processes around using one Kubernetes
object to modify the functions of one or more other objects.

This GEP defines some terms, firstly: _Metaresource_.

A Kubernetes object that _augments_ the behavior of an object
in a standard way is called a _Metaresource_.

This document proposes controlling the creation of configuration in the underlying
Gateway data plane using two types of Policy Attachment.
A "Policy Attachment" is a specific type of _metaresource_ that can affect specific
settings across either one object (this is "Direct Policy Attachment"), or objects
in a hierarchy (this is "Inherited Policy Attachment").

Individual policy APIs:
- must be their own CRDs (e.g. `TimeoutPolicy`, `RetryPolicy` etc),
- can be included in the Gateway API group and installation or be defined by
  implementations
- and must include a common `TargetRef` struct in their specification to identify
  how and where to apply that policy.
- _may_ include either a `defaults` section, an `overrides` section, or both. If
  these are included, the Policy is an Inherited Policy, and should use the
  inheritance rules defined in this document.

For Inherited Policies, this GEP also describes a set of expected behaviors
for how settings can flow across a defined hierarchy.


## Goals

* Establish a pattern for Policy resources which will be used for any policies
  included in the Gateway API spec
* Establish a pattern for Policy attachment, whether Direct or Inherited,
  which must be used for any implementation specific policies used with
  Gateway API resources
* Provide a way to distinguish between required and default values for all
  policy API implementations
* Enable policy attachment at all relevant scopes, including Gateways, Routes,
  Backends, along with how values should flow across a hierarchy if necessary
* Ensure the policy attachment specification is generic and forward thinking
  enough that it could be easily adapted to other grouping mechanisms like
  Namespaces in the future
* Provide a means of attachment that works for both ingress and mesh
  implementations of this API
* Provide a consistent specification that will ensure familiarity between both
  included and implementation-specific policies so they can both be interpreted
  the same way.

## Out of scope

* Define all potential policies that may be attached to resources
* Design the full structure and configuration of policies

## Background and concepts

When designing Gateway API, one of the things we’ve found is that we often need to be
able change the behavior of objects without being able to make changes to the spec
of those objects. Sometimes, this is because we can’t change the spec of the object
to hold the information we need ( ReferenceGrant, from
[GEP-709](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-709/), affecting Secrets
and Services is an example, as is Direct Policy Attachment), and sometimes it’s
because we want the behavior change to flow across multiple objects
(this is what Inherited Policy Attachment is for).

To put this another way, sometimes we need ways to be able to affect how an object
is interpreted in the API, without representing the description of those effects
inside the spec of the object.

This document describes the ways we design objects to meet these two use cases,
and why you might choose one or the other.

We use the term “metaresource” to describe the class of objects that _only_ augment
the behavior of another Kubernetes object, regardless of what they are targeting.

“Meta” here is used in its Greek sense of “more comprehensive”
or “transcending”, and “resource” rather than “object” because “metaresource”
is more pronounceable than “metaobject”. Additionally, a single word is better
than a phrase like “wrapper object” or “wrapper resource” overall, although both
of those terms are effectively synonymous with “metaresource”.

A "Policy Attachment" is a metaresource that affects the fields in existing objects
(like Gateway or Routes), or influences the configuration that's generated in an
underlying data plane.

"Direct Policy Attachment" is when a Policy object references a single object _only_,
and only modifies the fields of or the configuration associated with that object.

"Inherited Policy Attachment" is when a Policy object references a single object
_and any child objects of that object_ (according to some defined hierarchy), and
modifies fields of the child objects, or configuration associated with the child
objects.

In either case, a Policy may either affect an object by controlling the value
of one of the existing _fields_ in the `spec` of an object, or it may add
additional fields that are _not_ in the `spec` of the object.

### Direct Policy Attachment

A Direct Policy Attachment is tightly bound to one instance of a particular
Kind within a single namespace (or to an instance of a single Kind at cluster scope),
and only modifies the behavior of the object that matches its binding.

As an example, one use case that Gateway API currently does not support is how
to configure details of the TLS required to connect to a backend (in other words,
if the process running inside the backend workload expects TLS, not that some
automated infrastructure layer is provisioning TLS as in the Mesh case).

A hypothetical TLSConnectionPolicy that targets a Service could be used for this,
using the functionality of the Service as describing a set of endpoints. (It
should also be noted this is not the only way to solve this problem, just an
example to illustrate Direct Policy Attachment.)

The TLSConnectionPolicy would look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: TLSConnectionPolicy
metadata:
  name: tlsport8443
  namespace: foo
spec:
  targetRef: # This struct is defined as part of Gateway API
    group: "" # Empty string means core - this is a standard convention
    kind: Service
    name: fooService
  tls:
    certificateAuthorityRefs:
      - name: CAcert
    port: 8443

```

All this does is tell an implementation, that for connecting to port `8443` on the
Service `fooService`, it should assume that the connection is TLS, and expect the
service's certificate to be validated by the chain in the `CAcert` Secret.

Importantly, this would apply to _every_ usage of that Service across any HTTPRoutes
in that namespace, which could be useful for a Service that is reused in a lot of
HTTPRoutes.

With these two examples in mind, here are some guidelines for when to consider
using Direct Policy Attachment:

* The number or scope of objects to be modified is limited or singular. Direct
  Policy Attachments must target one specific object.
* The modifications to be made to the objects don’t have any transitive information -
  that is, the modifications only affect the single object that the targeted
  metaresource is bound to, and don’t have ramifications that flow beyond that
  object.
* In terms of status, it should be reasonably easy for a user to understand that
  everything is working - basically, as long as the targeted object exists, and
  the modifications are valid, the metaresource is valid, and this should be
  straightforward to communicate in one or two Conditions. Note that at the time
  of writing, this is *not* completed.
* Direct Policy Attachment _should_ only be used to target objects in the same
  namespace as the Policy object. Allowing cross-namespace references brings in
  significant security concerns, and/or difficulties about merging cross-namespace
  policy objects. Notably, Mesh use cases may need to do something like this for
  consumer policies, but in general, Policy objects that modify the behavior of
  things outside their own namespace should be avoided unless it uses a handshake
  of some sort, where the things outside the namespace can opt–out of the behavior.
  (Notably, this is the design that we used for ReferenceGrant).

### Inherited Policy Attachment: It's all about the defaults and overrides

Because a Inherited Policy is a metaresource, it targets some other resource
and _augments_ its behavior.

But why have this distinct from other types of metaresource? Because Inherited
Policy resources are designed to have a way for settings to flow down a hierarchy.

Defaults set the default value for something, and can be overridden by the
“lower” objects (like a connection timeout default policy on a Gateway being
overridable inside a HTTPRoute), and Overrides cannot be overridden by “lower”
objects (like setting a maximum client timeout to some non-infinite value at the
Gateway level to stop HTTPRoute owners from leaking connections over time).

Here are some guidelines for when to consider using a Inherited Policy object:

* The settings or configuration are bound to one containing object, but affect
  other objects attached to that one (for example, affecting HTTPRoutes attached
  to a single Gateway, or all HTTPRoutes in a GatewayClass).
* The settings need to able to be defaulted, but can be overridden on a per-object
  basis.
* The settings must be enforced by one persona, and not modifiable or removable
  by a lesser-privileged persona. (The owner of a GatewayClass may want to restrict
  something about all Gateways in a GatewayClass, regardless of who owns the Gateway,
  or a Gateway owner may want to enforce some setting across all attached HTTPRoutes).
* In terms of status, a good accounting for how to record that the Policy is
  attached is easy, but recording what resources the Policy is being applied to
  is not, and needs to be carefully designed to avoid fanout apiserver load.
  (This is not built at all in the current design either).

When multiple Inherited Policies are used, they can interact in various ways,
which are governed by the following rules, which will be expanded on later in this document.

* If a Policy does not affect an object's fields directly, then the resultant
  Policy should be the set of all distinct fields inside the relevant Policy objects,
  as set out by the rules below.
* For Policies that affect an object's existing fields, multiple instances of the
  same Policy Kind affecting an object's fields will be evaluated as
  though only a single Policy "wins" the right to affect each field. This operation
  is performed on a _per-distinct-field_ basis.
* Settings in `overrides` stanzas will win over the same setting in a `defaults`
  stanza.
* `overrides` settings operate in a "less specific beats more specific" fashion -
  Policies attached _higher_ up the hierarchy will beat the same type of Policy
  attached further down the hierarchy.
* `defaults` settings operate in a "more specific beats less specific" fashion -
  Policies attached _lower down_ the hierarchy will beat the same type of Policy
  attached further _up_ the hierarchy.
* For `defaults`, the _most specific_ value is the one _inside the object_ that
  the Policy applies to; that is, if a Policy specifies a `default`, and an object
  specifies a value, the _object's_ value will win.
* Policies interact with the fields they are controlling in a "replace value"
  fashion.
  * For fields where the `value` is a scalar, (like a string or a number)
    should have their value _replaced_ by the value in the Policy if it wins.
    Notably, this means that a `default` will only ever replace an empty or unset
    value in an object.
  * For fields where the value is an object, the Policy should include the fields
    in the object in its definition, so that the replacement can be on simple fields
    rather than complex ones.
  * For fields where the final value is non-scalar, but is not an _object_ with
    fields of its own, the value should be entirely replaced, _not_ merged. This
    means that lists of strings or lists of ints specified in a Policy will overwrite
    the empty list (in the case of a `default`) or any specified list (in the case
    of an `override`). The same applies to `map[string]string` fields. An example
    here would be a field that stores a map of annotations - specifying a Policy
    that overrides annotations will mean that a final object specifying those
    annotations will have its value _entirely replaced_ by an `override` setting.
* In the case that two Policies of the same type specify different fields, then
  _all_ of the specified fields should take effect on the affected object.

Examples to further illustrate these rules are given below.

## Naming Policy objects

The preceding rules discuss how Policy objects should _behave_, but this section
describes how Policy objects should be _named_.

Policy objects should be clearly named so as to indicate that they are Policy
metaresources.

The simplest way to do that is to ensure that the type's name contains the `Policy`
string.

Implementations _should_ use `Policy` as the last part of the names of object types
that use this pattern.

If an implementation does not, then they _must_ clearly document what objects
are Policy metaresources in their documentation. Again, this is _not recommended_
without a _very_ good reason.

## Policy Attachment examples and behavior

This approach is building on concepts from all of the alternatives discussed
below. This is very similar to the (now removed) BackendPolicy resource in the API,
but also borrows some concepts from the [ServicePolicy
proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/611).

### Policy Attachment for Ingress
Attaching a Directly Attached Policy to Gateway resources for ingress use cases
is relatively straightforward. A policy can reference the resource it wants to
apply to.

Access is granted with RBAC - anyone that has access to create a RetryPolicy in
a given namespace can attach it to any resource within that namespace.

![Simple Ingress Example](images/713-ingress-simple.png)

An Inherited Policy can attach to a parent resource, and then each policy
applies to the referenced resource and everything below it in terms of hierarchy.
Although this example is likely more complex than many real world
use cases, it helps demonstrate how policy attachment can work across
namespaces.

![Complex Ingress Example](images/713-ingress-complex.png)

### Policy Attachment for Mesh
Although there is a great deal of overlap between ingress and mesh use cases,
mesh enables more complex policy attachment scenarios. For example, you may want
to apply policy to requests from a specific namespace to a backend in another
namespace.

![Simple Mesh Example](images/713-mesh-simple.png)

Policy attachment can be quite simple with mesh. Policy can be applied to any
resource in any namespace but it can only apply to requests from the same
namespace if the target is in a different namespace.

At the other extreme, policy can be used to apply to requests from a specific
workload to a backend in another namespace. A route can be used to intercept
these requests and split them between different backends (foo-a and foo-b in
this case).

![Complex Mesh Example](images/713-mesh-complex.png)

### Policy TargetRef API

Each Policy resource MUST include a single `targetRef` field. It must not
target more than one resource at a time, but it can be used to target larger
resources such as Gateways or Namespaces that may apply to multiple child
resources.

As with most APIs, there are countless ways we could choose to expand this in
the future. This includes supporting multiple targetRefs and/or label selectors.
Although this would enable compelling functionality, it would increase the
complexity of an already complex API and potentially result in more conflicts
between policies. Although we may choose to expand the targeting capabilities
in the future, at this point it is strongly preferred to start with a simpler
pattern that still leaves room for future expansion.

The `targetRef` field MUST have the following structure:

```go
// PolicyTargetReference identifies an API object to apply policy to.
type PolicyTargetReference struct {
    // Group is the group of the target resource.
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Group string `json:"group"`

    // Kind is kind of the target resource.
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Kind string `json:"kind"`

    // Name is the name of the target resource.
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    Name string `json:"name"`

    // Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, the local
    // namespace is inferred. Even when policy targets a resource in a different
    // namespace, it may only apply to traffic originating from the same
    // namespace as the policy.
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    // +optional
    Namespace string `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
}
```

### Sample Policy API
The following structure can be used as a starting point for any Policy resource
using this API pattern. Note that the PolicyTargetReference struct defined above
will be distributed as part of the Gateway API.

```go
// ACMEServicePolicy provides a way to apply Service policy configuration with
// the ACME implementation of the Gateway API.
type ACMEServicePolicy struct {
    metav1.TypeMeta   `json:",inline"`
    metav1.ObjectMeta `json:"metadata,omitempty"`

    // Spec defines the desired state of ACMEServicePolicy.
    Spec ACMEServicePolicySpec `json:"spec"`

    // Status defines the current state of ACMEServicePolicy.
    Status ACMEServicePolicyStatus `json:"status,omitempty"`
}

// ACMEServicePolicySpec defines the desired state of ACMEServicePolicy.
type ACMEServicePolicySpec struct {
    // TargetRef identifies an API object to apply policy to.
    TargetRef gatewayv1a2.PolicyTargetReference `json:"targetRef"`

    // Override defines policy configuration that should override policy
    // configuration attached below the targeted resource in the hierarchy.
    // +optional
    Override *ACMEPolicyConfig `json:"override,omitempty"`

    // Default defines default policy configuration for the targeted resource.
    // +optional
    Default *ACMEPolicyConfig `json:"default,omitempty"`
}

// ACMEPolicyConfig contains ACME policy configuration.
type ACMEPolicyConfig struct {
    // Add configurable policy here
}

// ACMEServicePolicyStatus defines the observed state of ACMEServicePolicy.
type ACMEServicePolicyStatus struct {
    // Conditions describe the current conditions of the ACMEServicePolicy.
    //
    // +optional
    // +listType=map
    // +listMapKey=type
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=8
    Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`
}
```

### Hierarchy
Each policy MAY include default or override values. Default values are given
precedence from the bottom up, while override values are top down. That means
that a default attached to a Backend will have the highest precedence among
default values while an override value attached to a GatewayClass will have the
highest precedence overall.

![Ingress and Sidecar Hierarchy](images/713-hierarchy.png)

To illustrate this, consider 3 resources with the following hierarchy:
A > B > C. When attaching the concept of defaults and overrides to that, the
hierarchy would be expanded to this:

A override > B override > C override > C default > B default > A default.

Note that the hierarchy is reversed for defaults. The rationale here is that
overrides usually need to be enforced top down while defaults should apply to
the lowest resource first. For example, if an admin needs to attach required
policy, they can attach it as an override to a Gateway. That would have
precedence over Routes and Services below it. On the other hand, an app owner
may want to set a default timeout for their Service. That would have precedence
over defaults attached at higher levels such as Route or Gateway.

If using defaults _and_ overrides, each policy resource MUST include 2 structs
within the spec. One with override values and the other with default values.

In the following example, the policy attached to the Gateway requires cdn to
be enabled and provides some default configuration for that. The policy attached
to the Route changes the value for one of those fields (includeQueryString).

```yaml
kind: CDNCachingPolicy # Example of implementation specific policy name
spec:
  override:
    cdn:
      enabled: true
  default:
    cdn:
      cachePolicy:
        includeHost: true
        includeProtocol: true
        includeQueryString: true
  targetRef:
    kind: Gateway
    name: example
---
kind: CDNCachingPolicy
spec:
  default:
    cdn:
      cachePolicy:
        includeQueryString: false
  targetRef:
    type: direct
    kind: HTTPRoute
    name: example
```

In this final example, we can see how the override attached to the Gateway has
precedence over the default drainTimeout value attached to the Route. At the
same time, we can see that the default connectionTimeout attached to the Route
has precedence over the default attached to the Gateway.

Also note how the different resources interact - fields that are not common across
objects _may_ both end up affecting the final object.

![Inherited Policy Example](images/713-policy-hierarchy.png)

#### Supported Resources
It is important to note that not every implementation will be able to support
policy attachment to each resource described in the hierarchy above. When that
is the case, implementations MUST clearly document which resources a policy may
be attached to.

#### Attaching Policy to GatewayClass
GatewayClass may be the trickiest resource to attach policy to. Policy
attachment relies on the policy being defined within the same scope as the
target. This ensures that only users with write access to a policy resource in a
given scope will be able to modify policy at that level. Since GatewayClass is a
cluster scoped resource, this means that any policy attached to it must also be
cluster scoped.

GatewayClass parameters provide an alternative to policy attachment that may be
easier for some implementations to support. These parameters can similarly be
used to set defaults and requirements for an entire GatewayClass.

### Targeting External Services
In some cases (likely limited to mesh) we may want to apply policies to requests
to external services. To accomplish this, implementations can choose to support
a reference to a virtual resource type:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.acme.io/v1alpha1
kind: RetryPolicy
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  default:
    maxRetries: 5
  targetRef:
    group: networking.acme.io
    kind: ExternalService
    name: foo.com
```

### Merging into existing `spec` fields

It's possible (even likely) that configuration in a Policy may need to be merged
into an existing object's fields somehow, particularly for Inherited policies.

When merging into an existing fields inside an object, Policy objects should
merge values at a scalar level, not at a struct or object level.

For example, in the `CDNCachingPolicy` example above, the `cdn` struct contains
a `cachePolicy` struct that contains fields. If an implementation was merging
this configuration into an existing object that contained the same fields, it
should merge the fields at a scalar level, with the `includeHost`,
`includeProtocol`, and `includeQueryString` values being defaulted if they were
not specified in the object being controlled. Similarly, for `overrides`, the
values of the innermost scalar fields should overwrite the scalar fields in the
affected object.

Implementations should not copy any structs from the Policy object directly into the
affected object, any fields that _are_ overridden should be overridden on a per-field
basis.

In the case that the field in the Policy affects a struct that is a member of a list,
each existing item in the list in the affected object should have each of its
fields compared to the corresponding fields in the Policy.

For non-scalar field _values_, like a list of strings, or a `map[string]string`
value, the _entire value_ must be overwritten by the value from the Policy. No
merging should take place. This mainly applies to `overrides`, since for
`defaults`, there should be no value present in a field on the final object.

This table shows how this works for various types:

|Type|Object config|Override Policy config|Result|
|----|-------------|----------------------|------|
|string| `key: "foo"` | `key: "bar"`  | `key: "bar"` |
|list| `key: ["a","b"]` | `key: ["c","d"]` | `key: ["c","d"]` |
|`map[string]string`| `key: {"foo": "a", "bar": "b"}` | `key: {"foo": "c", "bar": "d"}` | `key: {"foo": "c", "bar": "d"}` |


### Conflict Resolution
It is possible for multiple policies to target the same object _and_ the same
fields inside that object. If multiple policy resources target
the same resource _and_ have an identical field specified with different values,
precedence MUST be determined in order of the following criteria, continuing on
ties:

* Direct Policies override Inherited Policies. If preventing settings from
  being overwritten is important, implementations should only use Inherited
  Policies, and the `override` stanza that implies. Note also that it's not
  intended that Direct and Inherited Policies should overlap, so this should
  only come up in exceptional circumstances.
* Inside Inherited Policies, the same setting in `overrides` beats the one in
  `defaults`.
* The oldest Policy based on creation timestamp. For example, a Policy with a
  creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:03" is given precedence over a Policy
  with a creation timestamp of "2021-07-15 01:02:04".
* The Policy appearing first in alphabetical order by `{namespace}/{name}`. For
  example, foo/bar is given precedence over foo/baz.

For a better user experience, a validating webhook can be implemented to prevent
these kinds of conflicts all together.

## Status and the Discoverability Problem

So far, this document has talked about what Policy Attachment is, different types
of attachment, and how those attachments work.

Probably the biggest impediment to this GEP moving forward is the discoverability
problem; that is, it’s critical that an object owner be able to know what policy
is affecting their object, and ideally its contents.

To understand this a bit better, let’s consider this parable, with thanks to Flynn:

### The Parable

It's a sunny Wednesday afternoon, and the lead microservices developer for
Evil Genius Cupcakes is windsurfing. Work has been eating Ana alive for the
past two and a half weeks, but after successfully deploying version 3.6.0 of
the `baker` service this morning, she's escaped early to try to unwind a bit.

Her shoulders are just starting to unknot when her phone pings with a text
from Charlie, down in the NOC. Waterproof phones are a blessing, but also a
curse.

**Charlie**: _Hey Ana. Things are still running, more or less, but latencies
on everything in the `baker` namespace are crazy high after your last rollout,
and `baker` itself has a weirdly high load. Sorry to interrupt you on the lake
but can you take a look? Thanks!!_

Ana stares at the phone for a long moment, heart sinking, then sighs and
turns back to shore.

What she finds when dries off and grabs her laptop is strange. `baker` does
seem to be taking much more load than its clients are sending, and its clients
report much higher latencies than they’d expect. She doublechecks the
Deployment, the Service, and all the HTTPRoutes around `baker`; everything
looks good. `baker`’s logs show her mostly failed requests... with a lot of
duplicates? Ana checks her HTTPRoute again, though she's pretty sure you
can't configure retries there, and finds nothing. But it definitely looks like
clients are retrying when they shouldn’t be.

She pings Charlie.

**Ana**: _Hey Charlie. Something weird is up, looks like requests to `baker`
are failing but getting retried??_

A minute later they answer.

**Charlie**: 🤷 _Did you configure retries?_

**Ana**: _Dude. I don’t even know how to._ 😂

**Charlie**: _You just attach a RetryPolicy to your HTTPRoute._

**Ana**: _Nope. Definitely didn’t do that._

She types `kubectl get retrypolicy -n baker` and gets a permission error.

**Ana**: _Huh, I actually don’t have permissions for RetryPolicy._ 🤔

**Charlie**: 🤷 _Feels like you should but OK, guess that can’t be it._

Minutes pass while both look at logs.

**Charlie**: _I’m an idiot. There’s a RetryPolicy for the whole namespace –
sorry, too many policies in the dashboard and I missed it. Deleting that since
you don’t want retries._

**Ana**: _Are you sure that’s a good–_

Ana’s phone shrills while she’s typing, and she drops it. When she picks it
up again she sees a stack of alerts. She goes pale as she quickly flips
through them: there’s one for every single service in the `baker` namespace.

**Ana**: _PUT IT BACK!!_

**Charlie**: _Just did. Be glad you couldn't hear all the alarms here._ 😕

**Ana**: _What the hell just happened??_

**Charlie**: _At a guess, all the workloads in the `baker` namespace actually
fail a lot, but they seem OK because there are retries across the whole
namespace?_ 🤔

Ana's blood runs cold.

**Charlie**: _Yeah. Looking a little closer, I think your `baker` rollout this
morning would have failed without those retries._ 😕

There is a pause while Ana's mind races through increasingly unpleasant
possibilities.

**Ana**: _I don't even know where to start here. How long did that
RetryPolicy go in? Is it the only thing like it?_

**Charlie**: _Didn’t look closely before deleting it, but I think it said a few
months ago. And there are lots of different kinds of policy and lots of
individual policies, hang on a minute..._

**Charlie**: _Looks like about 47 for your chunk of the world, a couple hundred
system-wide._

**Ana**: 😱 _Can you tell me what they’re doing for each of our services? I
can’t even_ look _at these things._ 😕

**Charlie**: _That's gonna take awhile. Our tooling to show us which policies
bind to a given workload doesn't go the other direction._

**Ana**: _...wait. You have to_ build tools _to know if retries are turned on??_

Pause.

**Charlie**: _Policy attachment is more complex than we’d like, yeah._ 😐
_Look, how ‘bout roll back your `baker` change for now? We can get together in
the morning and start sorting this out._

Ana shakes her head and rolls back her edits to the `baker` Deployment, then
sits looking out over the lake as the deployment progresses.

**Ana**: _Done. Are things happier now?_

**Charlie**: _Looks like, thanks. Reckon you can get back to your sailboard._ 🙂

Ana sighs.

**Ana**: _Wish I could. Wind’s died down, though, and it'll be dark soon.
Just gonna head home._

**Charlie**: _Ouch. Sorry to hear that._ 😐

One more look out at the lake.

**Ana**: _Thanks for the help. Wish we’d found better answers._ 😢

### The Problem, restated
What this parable makes clear is that, in the absence of information about what
Policy is affecting an object, it’s very easy to make poor decisions.

It’s critical that this proposal solve the problem of showing up to three things,
listed in increasing order of desirability:

- _That_ some Policy is affecting a particular object
- _Which_ Policy is (or Policies are) affecting a particular object
- _What_ settings in the Policy are affecting the object.

In the parable, if Ana and Charlie had known that there were Policies affecting
the relevant object, then they could have gone looking for the relevant Policies
and things would have played out differently. If they knew which Policies, they
would need to look less hard, and if they knew what the settings being applied
were, then the parable would have been able to be very short indeed.

(There’s also another use case to consider, in that Charlie should have been able
to see that the Policy on the namespace was in use in many places before deleting
it.)

To put this another way, Policy Attachment is effectively adding a fourth Persona,
the Policy Admin, to Gateway API’s persona list, and without a solution to the
discoverability problem, their actions are largely invisible to the Application
Developer. Not only that, but their concerns cut across the previously established
levels.

![Gateway API diagram with Policy Admin](images/713-the-diagram-with-policy-admin.png)


From the Policy Admin’s point of view, they need to know across their whole remit
(which conceivably could be the whole cluster):

- _What_ Policy has been created
- _Where_ it’s applied
- _What_ the resultant policy is saying

Which again, come down to discoverability, and can probably be addressed in similar
ways at an API level to the Application Developer's concerns.

An important note here is that a key piece of information for Policy Admins and
Cluster Operators is “How many things does this Policy affect?”. In the parable,
this would have enabled Charlie to know that deleting the Namespace Policy would
affect many other people than just Ana.

### Problems we need to solve

Before we can get into solutions, we need to discuss the problems that solutions
may need to solve, so that we have some criteria for evaluating those solutions.

#### User discoverability

Let's go through the various users of Gateway API and what they need to know about
Policy Attachment.

In all of these cases, we should aim to keep the troubleshooting distance low;
that is, that there should be a minimum of hops required between objects from the
one owned by the user to the one responsible for a setting.

Another way to think of the troubleshooting distance in this context is "How many
`kubectl` commands would the user need to do to understand that a Policy is relevant,
which Policy is relevant, and what configuration the full set of Policy is setting?"

##### Application Developer Discoverability

How does Ana, or any Application Devloper who owns one or more Route objects know
that their object is affected by Policy, which Policy is affecting it, and what
the content of the Policy is?

The best outcome is that Ana needs to look only at a specific route to know what
Policy settings are being applied to that Route, and where they come from.
However, some of the other problems below make it very difficult to achieve this.

##### Policy Admin Discoverability

How does the Policy Admin know what Policy is applied where, and what the content
of that Policy is?
How do they validate that Policy is being used in ways acceptable to their organization?
For any given Policy object, how do they know how many places it's being used?

##### Cluster Admin Discoverability

The Cluster Admin has similar concerns to the Policy Admin, but with a focus on
being able to determine what's relevant when something is broken.

How does the Cluster Admin know what Policy is applied where, and what the content
of that Policy is?

For any given Policy object, how do they know how many places it's being used?

#### Evaluating and Displaying Resultant Policy

For any given Policy type, whether Direct Attached or Inherited, implementations
will need to be able to _calculate_ the resultant set of Policy to be able to
apply that Policy to the correct parts of their data plane configuration.
However, _displaying_ that resultant set of Policy in a way that is straightforward
for the various personas to consume is much harder.

The easiest possible option for Application Developers would be for the
implementation to make the full resultant set of Policy available in the status
of objects that the Policy affects. However, this runs into a few problems:

- The status needs to be namespaced by the implementation
- The status could get large if there are a lot of Policy objects affecting an
  object
- Building a common data representation pattern that can fit into a single common
  schema is not straightforward.
- Updating one Policy object could cause many affected objects to need to be
  updated themselves. This sort of fan-out problem can be very bad for apiserver
  load, particularly if Policy chnges rapidly, there are a lot of objects, or both.

##### Status needs to be namespaced by implementation

Because an object can be affected by multiple implementations at once, any status
we add must be namespaced by the implementation.

In Route Parent status, we've used the parentRef plus the controller name for this.

For Policy, we can do something similar and namespace by the reference to the
implementation's controller name.

We can't easily namespace by the originating Policy because the source could be
more than one Policy object.

##### Creating common data representation patterns

The problem here is that we need to have a _common_ pattern for including the
details of an _arbitrarily defined_ object, that needs to be included in the base
API.

So we can't use structured data, because we have no way of knowing what the
structure will be beforehand.

This suggests that we need to use unstructured data for representing the main
body of an arbitrary Policy object.

Practically, this will need to be a string representation of the YAML form of the
body of the Policy object (absent the metadata part of every Kubernetes object).

Policy Attachment does not mandate anything about the design of the object's top
level except that it must be a Kubernetes object, so the only thing we can rely
on is the presence of the Kubernetes metadata elements: `apiVersion`, `kind`,
and `metadata`.

A string representation of the rest of the file is the best we can do here.

##### Fanout status update problems

The fanout problem is that, when an update takes place in a single object (a
Policy, or an object with a Policy attached), an implementation may need to
update _many_ objects if it needs to place details of what Policy applies, or
what the resultant set of policy is on _every_ object.

Historically, this is a risky strategy and needs to be carefully applied, as
it's an excellent way to create apiserver load problems, which can produce a large
range of bad effects for cluster stability.

This does not mean that we can't do anything at all that affects multiple objects,
but that we need to carefully consider what information is stored in status so 
that _every_ Policy update does not require a status update.

#### Solution summary

Because Policy Attachment is a pattern for APIs, not an API, and needs to address
all the problems above, the strategy this GEP proposes is to define a range of
options for increasing the discoverabilty of Policy resources, and provide
guidelines for when they should be used.

It's likely that at some stage, the Gateway API CRDs will include some Policy
resources, and these will be designed with all these discoverabiity solutions
in mind.


### Solution cookbook

This section contains some required patterns for Policy objects and some
suggestions. Each will be marked as MUST, SHOULD, or MAY, using the standard 
meanings of those terms.

Additionally, the status of each solution is noted at the beginning of the section.

#### Standard label on CRD objects

Status: Required

Each CRD that defines a Policy object MUST include a label that specifies that
it is a Policy object, and that label MUST specify the _type_ of Policy attachment
in use.

The label is `gateway.networking.k8s.io/policy: inherited|direct`.

This solution is intended to allow both users and tooling to identify which CRDs
in the cluster should be treated as Policy objects, and so is intended to help
with discoverability generally. It will also be used by the forthcoming `kubectl`
plugin.

##### Design considerations

This is already part of the API pattern, but is being lifted to more prominience
here.

#### Standard status struct

Status: Experimental

Policy objects SHOULD use the upstream `PolicyAncestorStatus` struct in their respective
Status structs. Please see the included `PolicyAncestorStatus` struct, and its use in
the `BackendTLSPolicy` object for detailed examples. Included here is a representative
version.

This pattern enables different conditions to be set for different "Ancestors"
of the target resource. This is particularly helpful for policies that may be
implemented by multiple controllers or attached to resources with different
capabilities. This pattern also provides a clear view of what resources a
policy is affecting.

For the best integration with community tooling and consistency across
the broader community, we recommend that all implementations transition 
to Policy status with this kind of nested structure.

This is an `Ancestor` status rather than a `Parent` status, as in the Route status
because for Policy attachment, the relevant object may or may not be the direct
parent.

For example, `BackendTLSPolicy` directly attaches to a Service, which may be included
in multiple Routes, in multiple Gateways. However, for many implementations, 
the status of the `BackendTLSPolicy` will be different only at the Gateway level, 
so Gateway is the relevant Ancestor for the status.

Each Gateway that has a Route that includes a backend with an attached `BackendTLSPolicy`
MUST have a separate `PolicyAncestorStatus` section in the `BackendTLSPolicy`'s
`status.ancestors` stanza, which mandates that entries must be distinct using the
combination of the `AncestorRef` and the `ControllerName` fields as a key.

See [GEP-1897][gep-1897] for the exact details.

[gep-1897]: /geps/gep-1897

```go
// PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
// associated Ancestor.
//
// Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it in terms
// of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, an Ancestor could be
// a Route or a Gateway. 

// In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
// resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
// targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.
// 
// Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the 
// ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
// Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
// implementations. 
//
// For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
// used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
// In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
// ancestor object referred to in this status.
//
// Note that a Target of a Policy is also a valid Ancestor, so for objects where
// the Target is the relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.
type PolicyAncestorStatus struct {
	// AncestorRef corresponds with a ParentRef in the spec that this
	// RouteParentStatus struct describes the status of.
	AncestorRef ParentReference `json:"ancestorRef"`

	// ControllerName is a domain/path string that indicates the name of the
	// controller that wrote this status. This corresponds with the
	// controllerName field on GatewayClass.
	//
	// Example: "example.net/gateway-controller".
	//
	// The format of this field is DOMAIN "/" PATH, where DOMAIN and PATH are
	// valid Kubernetes names
	// (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).
	//
	// Controllers MUST populate this field when writing status. Controllers should ensure that
	// entries to status populated with their ControllerName are cleaned up when they are no
	// longer necessary.
	ControllerName GatewayController `json:"controllerName"`

	// Conditions describes the status of the Policy with respect to the given Ancestor.
	//
	// +listType=map
	// +listMapKey=type
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MinItems=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=8
	Conditions []metav1.Condition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`
}


// PolicyStatus defines the common attributes that all Policies SHOULD include
// within their status.
type PolicyStatus struct {
	// Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
	// associated with the route, and the status of the route with respect to
	// each ancestor. When this route attaches to a parent, the controller that
	// manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
	// the controller first sees the route and SHOULD update the entry as
	// appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.
	//
	// Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
	// an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
	// which to namespace this status.
	//
	// Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for 
	// the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
	// use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
	// that they are responsible for.
	//
	// A maximum of 32 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
	// means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.
	//
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxItems=32
	Ancestors []PolicyAncestorStatus `json:"ancestors"`
}
```

##### Design considerations

This is recommended as the base for Policy object's status. As Policy Attachment
is a pattern, not an API, "recommended" is the strongest we can make this, but
we believe that standardizing this will help a lot with discoverability.

Note that is likely that all Gateway API tooling will expect policy status to follow
this structure. To benefit from broader consistency and discoverability, we
recomment transitioning to this structure for all Gateway API Policies.

#### Standard status Condition on Policy-affected objects

Support: Provisional

This solution is IN PROGRESS and so is not binding yet.

This solution requires definition in a GEP of its own to become binding.

**The description included here is intended to illustrate the sort of solution
that an eventual GEP will need to provide, _not to be a binding design.**

Implementations that use Policy objects MUST put a Condition into `status.Conditions`
of any objects affected by a Policy.

That Condition must have a `type` ending in `PolicyAffected` (like
`gateway.networking.k8s.io/PolicyAffected`),
and have the optional `observedGeneration` field kept up to date when the `spec`
of the Policy-attached object changes.

Implementations _should_ use their own unique domain prefix for this Condition
`type` - it is recommended that implementations use the same domain as in the
`controllerName` field on GatewayClass (or some other implementation-unique
domain for implementations that do not use GatewayClass).)

For objects that do _not_ have a `status.Conditions` field available (`Secret`
is a good example), that object MUST instead have an annotation of
`gateway.networking.k8s.io/PolicyAffected: true` (or with an
implementation-specifc domain prefix) added instead.


##### Design Considerations
The intent here is to add at least a breadcrumb that leads object owners to have
some way to know that their object is being affected by another object, while
minimizing the number of updates necessary.

Minimizing the object updates is done by only having an update be necesary when
the affected object starts or stops being affected by a Policy, rather than if
the Policy itself has been updated.

There is already a similar Condition to be placed on _Policy_ objects, rather
than on the _targeted_ objects, so this solution is also being included in the
Condiions section below.

#### GatewayClass status Extension Types listing

Support: Provisional

This solution is IN PROGRESS, and so is not binding yet.

Each impelementation MUST list all relevant CRDs in its GatewayClass status (like
Policy, and other extension types, like paramsRef targets, filters, and so on). 

This is going to be tracked in its own GEP, https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/discussions/2118
is the initial discussion. This document will be updated with the details once
that GEP is opened.

##### Design Considerations

This solution:

- is low cost in terms of apiserver updates (because it's only on the GatewayClass,
  and only on implementation startup)
- provides a standard place for all users to look for relevant objects
- ties in to the Conformance Profiles design and other efforts about GatewayClass 
  status

#### Standard status stanza

Support: Provisional

This solution is IN PROGRESS and so is not binding yet.

This solution requires definition in a GEP of its own to become binding.

**The description included here is intended to illustrate the sort of solution
that an eventual GEP will need to provide, _not to be a binding design. THIS IS
AN EXPERIMENTAL SOLUTION DO NOT USE THIS YET.**

An implementation SHOULD include the name, namespace, apiGroup and Kind of Policies
affecting an object in the new `effectivePolicy` status stanza on Gateway API
objects.

This stanza looks like this:
```yaml
kind: Gateway
...
status:
  effectivePolicy:
  - name: some-policy
    namespace: some-namespace
    apiGroup: implementation.io
    kind: AwesomePolicy
  ...
```

##### Design Considerations

This solution is designed to limit the number of status updates required by an
implementation to when a Policy starts or stops being relevant for an object,
rather than if that Policy's settings are updated.

It helps a lot with discoverability, but comes at the cost of a reasonably high
fanout cost. Implemenations using this solution should ensure that status updates
are deduplicated and only sent to the apiserver when absolutely necessary.

Ideally, these status updates SHOULD be in a separate, lower-priority queue than
other status updates or similar solution.

#### PolicyBinding resource

Support: Provisional

This solution is IN PROGRESS and so is not binding yet.

This solution requires definition in a GEP of its own to become binding.

**The description included here is intended to illustrate the sort of solution
that the eventual GEP will need to provide, _not to be a binding design. THIS IS
AN EXPERIMENTAL SOLUTION DO NOT USE THIS YET.**

Implemenations SHOULD create an instance of a new `gateway.networking.k8s.io/EffectivePolicy`
object when one or more Policy objects become relevant to the target object.

The `EffectivePolicy` object MUST be in the same namespace as the object targeted
by the Policy, and must have the _same name_ as the object targeted like the Policy.
This is intended to mirror the Services/Endpoints naming convention, to allow for
ease of discovery.

The `EffectivePolicy` object MUST set the following information:

- The name, namespace, apiGroup and Kind of Policy objects affecting the targeted
  object.
- The full resultant set of Policy affecting the targeted object.

The above details MUST be namespaced using the `controllerName` of the implementation
(could also be by GatewayClass), similar to Route status being namespaced by
`parentRef`.

An example `EffectivePolicy` object is included here - this may be superseded by
a later GEP and should be updated or removed in that case. Note that it does
_not_ contain a `spec` and a `status` stanza - by definition this object _only_
contains `status` information.

```yaml
kind: EffectivePolicy
apiVersion: gateway.networkking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: targeted-object
  namespace: targeted-object-namespace
policies:
- controllerName: implementation.io/ControllerName
  objects:
  - name: some-policy
    namespace: some-namespace
    apiGroup: implementation.io
    kind: AwesomePolicy
  resultantPolicy:
    awesomePolicy:
      configitem1:
        defaults:
          foo: 1
        overrides:
          bar: important-setting

```

Note here that the `resultantPolicy` setting is defined using the same mechanisms
as an `unstructured.Unstructured` object in the Kubernetes Go libraries - it's
effectively a `map[string]struct{}` that is stored as a `map[string]string` -
which allows an arbitrary object to be specified there.

Users or tools reading the config underneath `resultantPolicy` SHOULD display
it in its encoded form, and not try to deserialize it in any way.

The rendered YAML MUST be usable as the `spec` for the type given.

##### Design considerations

This will provide _full_ visibility to end users of the _actual settings_ being
applied to their object, which is a big discoverability win.

However, it relies on the establishment and communication of a convention ("An 
EffectivePolicy is right next to your affected object"), that may not be desirable.

Thus its status as EXPERIMENTAL DO NOT USE YET.

#### Validating Admission Controller to inform users about relevant Policy

Implementations MAY supply a Validating Admission Webhook that will return a
WARNING message when an applied object is affected by some Policy, which may be 
an inherited or indirect one.

The warning message MAY include the name, namespace, apiGroup and Kind of relevant
Policy objects.

##### Design Considerations

Pro:

- This gives object owners a very clear signal that something some Policy is
  going to affect their object, at apply time, which helps a lot with discoverability.

Cons:

- Implementations would have to have a webhook, which is another thing to run.
- The webhook will need to have the same data model that the implementation uses,
  and keep track of which GatewayClasses, Gateways, Routes, and Policies are
  relevant. Experience suggests this will not be a trivial engineering exercise,and will add a lot of implementation complexity.

#### `kubectl` plugin or command-line tool
To help improve UX and standardization, a kubectl plugin will be developed that
will be capable of describing the computed sum of policy that applies to a given
resource, including policies applied to parent resources.

Each Policy CRD that wants to be supported by this plugin will need to follow
the API structure defined above and add a `gateway.networking.k8s.io/policy: true`
label to the CRD.

### Conditions

Implementations using Policy objects MUST include a `spec` and `status` stanza, and the `status` stanza MUST contain a `conditions` stanza, using the standard Condition format.

Policy authors should consider namespacing the `conditions` stanza with a
`controllerName`, as in Route status, if more than one implementation will be
reconciling the Policy type.

#### On `Policy` objects

Controllers using the Gateway API policy attachment model MUST populate the 
`Accepted` condition and reasons as defined below on policy resources to provide
a consistent experience across implementations.

```go
// PolicyConditionType is a type of condition for a policy.
type PolicyConditionType string

// PolicyConditionReason is a reason for a policy condition.
type PolicyConditionReason string

const (
  // PolicyConditionAccepted indicates whether the policy has been accepted or rejected
  // by a targeted resource, and why.
  //
  // Possible reasons for this condition to be True are:
  //
  // * "Accepted"
  //
  // Possible reasons for this condition to be False are:
  //
  // * "Conflicted"
  // * "Invalid"
  // * "TargetNotFound"
  //
  PolicyConditionAccepted PolicyConditionType = "Accepted"

  // PolicyReasonAccepted is used with the "Accepted" condition when the policy has been
  // accepted by the targeted resource.
  PolicyReasonAccepted PolicyConditionReason = "Accepted"

  // PolicyReasonConflicted is used with the "Accepted" condition when the policy has not
  // been accepted by a targeted resource because there is another policy that targets the same
  // resource and a merge is not possible.
  PolicyReasonConflicted PolicyConditionReason = "Conflicted"

  // PolicyReasonInvalid is used with the "Accepted" condition when the policy is syntactically
  // or semantically invalid.
  PolicyReasonInvalid PolicyConditionReason = "Invalid"

  // PolicyReasonTargetNotFound is used with the "Accepted" condition when the policy is attached to
  // an invalid target resource
  PolicyReasonTargetNotFound PolicyConditionReason = "TargetNotFound"
)
```

#### On targeted resources

(copied from [Standard Status Condition][#standard-status-condition])

This solution requires definition in a GEP of its own to become binding.

**The description included here is intended to illustrate the sort of solution
that an eventual GEP will need to provide, _not to be a binding design.**

Implementations that use Policy objects MUST put a Condition into `status.Conditions`
of any objects affected by a Policy.

That Condition must have a `type` ending in `PolicyAffected` (like
`gateway.networking.k8s.io/PolicyAffected`),
and have the optional `observedGeneration` field kept up to date when the `spec`
of the Policy-attached object changes.

Implementations _should_ use their own unique domain prefix for this Condition
`type` - it is recommended that implementations use the same domain as in the
`controllerName` field on GatewayClass (or some other implementation-unique
domain for implementations that do not use GatewayClass).)

For objects that do _not_ have a `status.Conditions` field available (`Secret`
is a good example), that object MUST instead have an annotation of
`gateway.networking.k8s.io/PolicyAffected: true` (or with an
implementation-specifc domain prefix) added instead.

### Interaction with Custom Filters and other extension points
There are multiple methods of custom extension in the Gateway API. Policy
attachment and custom Route filters are two of these. Policy attachment is
designed to provide arbitrary configuration fields that decorate Gateway API
resources. Route filters provide custom request/response filters embedded inside
Route resources. Both are extension methods for fields that cannot easily be
standardized as core or extended fields of the Gateway API. The following
guidance should be considered when introducing a custom field into any Gateway
controller implementation:

1. For any given field that a Gateway controller implementation needs, the
   possibility of using core or extended should always be considered before
   using custom policy resources. This is encouraged to promote standardization
   and, over time, to absorb capabilities into the API as first class fields,
   which offer a more streamlined UX than custom policy attachment.

2. Although it's possible that arbitrary fields could be supported by custom
   policy, custom route filters, and core/extended fields concurrently, it is
   recommended that implementations only use multiple mechanisms for
   representing the same fields when those fields really _need_ the defaulting
   and/or overriding behavior that Policy Attachment provides. For example, a
   custom filter that allowed the configuration of Authentication inside a
   HTTPRoute object might also have an associated Policy resource that allowed
   the filter's settings to be defaulted or overridden. It should be noted that
   doing this in the absence of a solution to the status problem is likely to
   be *very* difficult to troubleshoot.

### Conformance Level
This policy attachment pattern is associated with an "EXTENDED" conformance
level. The implementations that support this policy attachment model will have
the same behavior and semantics, although they may not be able to support
attachment of all types of policy at all potential attachment points.

### Apply Policies to Sections of a Resource
Policies can target specific matches within nested objects. For instance, rather than
applying a policy to the entire Gateway, we may want to attach it to a particular Gateway listener.

To achieve this, an optional `sectionName` field can be set in the `targetRef` of a policy
to refer to a specific listener within the target Gateway.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: foo-gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: foo-lb
  listeners:
  - name: bar
    ...
---
apiVersion: networking.acme.io/v1alpha2
kind: AuthenticationPolicy
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  provider:
    issuer: "https://oidc.example.com"
  targetRef:
    name: foo-gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    sectionName: bar
```

The `sectionName` field can also be used to target a specific section of other resources:

* Service.Ports.Name
* xRoute.Rules.Name

For example, the RetryPolicy below applies to a RouteRule inside an HTTPRoute.

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: http-app-1
  labels:
    app: foo
spec:
  hostnames:
  - "foo.com"
  rules:
  - name: bar
    matches:
    - path:
        type: Prefix
        value: /bar
    forwardTo:
    - serviceName: my-service1
      port: 8080
---
apiVersion: networking.acme.io/v1alpha2
kind: RetryPolicy
metadata:
  name: foo
spec:
  maxRetries: 5
  targetRef:
    name: foo
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: HTTPRoute
    sectionName: bar
```

This would require adding a `name` field to those sub-resources that currently lack a name. For example,
a `name` field could be added to the `RouteRule` object:
```go
type RouteRule struct {
    // Name is the name of the Route rule. If more than one Route Rule is
    // present, each Rule MUST specify a name. The names of Rules MUST be unique
    // within a Route.
    //
    // Support: Core
    //
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
    // +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
    // +optional
    Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
    // ...
}
```

If a `sectionName` is specified, but does not exist on the targeted object, the Policy must fail to attach,
and the policy implementation should record a `resolvedRefs` or similar Condition in the Policy's status.

When multiple Policies of the same type target the same object, one with a `sectionName` specified, and one without,
the one with a `sectionName` is more specific, and so will have all its settings apply. The less-specific Policy will
not attach to the target.

Note that the `sectionName` is currently intended to be used only for Direct Policy Attachment when references to
SectionName are actually needed. Inherited Policies are always applied to the entire object. 
The `PolicyTargetReferenceWithSectionName` API can be used to apply a direct Policy to a section of an object.

### Advantages
* Incredibly flexible approach that should work well for both ingress and mesh
* Conceptually similar to existing ServicePolicy proposal and BackendPolicy
  pattern
* Easy to attach policy to resources we don’t control (Service, ServiceImport,
  etc)
* Minimal API changes required
* Simplifies packaging an application for deployment as policy references do not
  need to be part of the templating

### Disadvantages
* May be difficult to understand which policies apply to a request

## Examples

This section provides some examples of various types of Policy objects, and how
merging, `defaults`, `overrides`, and other interactions work.

### Direct Policy Attachment

The following Policy sets the minimum TLS version required on a Gateway Listener:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: TLSMinimumVersionPolicy
metadata:
  name: minimum12
  namespace: appns
spec:
  minimumTLSVersion: 1.2
  targetRef:
    name: internet
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
```

Note that because there is no version controlling the minimum TLS version in the
Gateway `spec`, this is an example of a non-field Policy.

### Inherited Policy Attachment

It also could be useful to be able to _default_ the `minimumTLSVersion` setting
across multiple Gateways.

This version of the above Policy allows this:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: TLSMinimumVersionPolicy
metadata:
  name: minimum12
  namespace: appns
spec:
  defaults:
    minimumTLSVersion: 1.2
  targetRef:
    name: appns
    group: ""
    kind: namespace
```

This Inherited Policy is using the implicit hierarchy that all resources belong
to a namespace, so attaching a Policy to a namespace means affecting all possible
resources in a namespace. Multiple hierarchies are possible, even within Gateway
API, for example Gateway -> Route, Gateway -> Route -> Backend, Gateway -> Route
-> Service. GAMMA Policies could conceivably use a hierarchy of Service -> Route
as well.

Note that this will not be very discoverable for Gateway owners in the absence of
a solution to the Policy status problem. This is being worked on and this GEP will
be updated once we have a design.

Conceivably, a security or admin team may want to _force_ Gateways to have at least
a minimum TLS version of `1.2` - that would be a job for `overrides`, like so:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: TLSMinimumVersionPolicy
metadata:
  name: minimum12
  namespace: appns
spec:
  overrides:
    minimumTLSVersion: 1.2
  targetRef:
    name: appns
    group: ""
    kind: namespace
```

This will make it so that _all Gateways_ in the `default` namespace _must_ use
a minimum TLS version of `1.2`, and this _cannot_ be changed by Gateway owners.
Only the Policy owner can change this Policy.

### Handling non-scalar values

In this example, we will assume that at some future point, HTTPRoute has grown
fields to configure retries, including a field called `retryOn` that reflects
the HTTP status codes that should be retried. The _value_ of this field is a
list of strings, being the HTTP codes that must be retried. The `retryOn` field
has no defaults in the field definitions (which is probably a bad design, but we
need to show this interaction somehow!)

We also assume that a Inherited `RetryOnPolicy` exists that allows both
defaulting and overriding of the `retryOn` field.

A full `RetryOnPolicy` to default the field to the codes `501`, `502`, and `503`
would look like this:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: RetryOnPolicy
metadata:
  name: retryon5xx
  namespace: appns
spec:
  defaults:
    retryOn:
      - "501"
      - "502"
      - "503"
  targetRef:
    kind: Gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    name: we-love-retries
```

This means that, for HTTPRoutes that do _NOT_ explicitly set this field to something
else, (in other words, they contain an empty list), then the field will be set to
a list containing `501`, `502`, and `503`. (Notably, because of Go zero values, this
would also occur if the user explicitly set the value to the empty list.)

However, if a HTTPRoute owner sets any value other than the empty list, then that
value will remain, and the Policy will have _no effect_. These values are _not_
merged.

If the Policy used `overrides` instead:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: RetryOnPolicy
metadata:
  name: retryon5xx
  namespace: appns
spec:
  overrides:
    retryOn:
      - "501"
      - "502"
      - "503"
  targetRef:
    kind: Gateway
    group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    name: you-must-retry
```

Then no matter what the value is in the HTTPRoute, it will be set to `501`, `502`,
`503` by the Policy override.

### Interactions between defaults, overrides, and field values

All HTTPRoutes that attach to the `YouMustRetry` Gateway will have any value
_overwritten_ by this policy. The empty list, or any number of values, will all
be replaced with `501`, `502`, and `503`.

Now, let's also assume that we use the Namespace -> Gateway hierarchy on top of
the Gateway -> HTTPRoute hierarchy, and allow attaching a `RetryOnPolicy` to a
_namespace_. The expectation here is that this will affect all Gateways in a namespace
and all HTTPRoutes that attach to those Gateways. (Note that the HTTPRoutes
themselves may not necessarily be in the same namespace though.)

If we apply the default policy from earlier to the namespace:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.example.io/v1alpha1
kind: RetryOnPolicy
metadata:
  name: retryon5xx
  namespace: appns
spec:
  defaults:
    retryOn:
      - "501"
      - "502"
      - "503"
  targetRef:
    kind: Namespace
    group: ""
    name: appns
```

Then this will have the same effect as applying that Policy to every Gateway in
the `default` namespace - namely that every HTTPRoute that attaches to every
Gateway will have its `retryOn` field set to `501`, `502`, `503`, _if_ there is no
other setting in the HTTPRoute itself.

With two layers in the hierarchy, we have a more complicated set of interactions
possible.

Let's look at some tables for a particular HTTPRoute, assuming that it does _not_
configure the `retryOn` field, for various types of Policy at different levels.

#### Overrides interacting with defaults for RetryOnPolicy, empty list in HTTPRoute

||None|Namespace override|Gateway override|HTTPRoute override|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No default|Empty list|Namespace override| Gateway override Policy| HTTPRoute override|
|Namespace default| Namespace default| Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override |
|Gateway default| Gateway default | Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override |
|HTTPRoute default| HTTPRoute default | Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override|

#### Overrides interacting with other overrides for RetryOnPolicy, empty list in HTTPRoute
||No override|Namespace override A|Gateway override A|HTTPRoute override A|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No override|Empty list|Namespace override| Gateway override| HTTPRoute override|
|Namespace override B| Namespace override B| Namespace override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | Namespace override B | Namespace override B|
|Gateway override B| Gateway override B | Namespace override A| Gateway override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | Gateway override B|
|HTTPRoute override B| HTTPRoute override B | Namespace override A| Gateway override A| HTTPRoute override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically|

#### Defaults interacting with other defaults for RetryOnPolicy, empty list in HTTPRoute
||No default|Namespace default A|Gateway default A|HTTPRoute default A|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No default|Empty list|Namespace default| Gateway default| HTTPRoute default A|
|Namespace default B| Namespace default B| Namespace default<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | Gateway default A | HTTPRoute default A|
|Gateway default B| Gateway default B| Gateway default B| Gateway default<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | HTTPRoute default A|
|HTTPRoute default B| HTTPRoute default B| HTTPRoute default B| HTTPRoute default B| HTTPRoute default<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically|


Now, if the HTTPRoute _does_ specify a RetryPolicy,
it's a bit easier, because we can basically disregard all defaults:

#### Overrides interacting with defaults for RetryOnPolicy, value in HTTPRoute

||None|Namespace override|Gateway override|HTTPRoute override|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No default| Value in HTTPRoute|Namespace override| Gateway override | HTTPRoute override|
|Namespace default|  Value in HTTPRoute| Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override |
|Gateway default|  Value in HTTPRoute | Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override |
|HTTPRoute default| Value in HTTPRoute | Namespace override | Gateway override | HTTPRoute override|

#### Overrides interacting with other overrides for RetryOnPolicy, value in HTTPRoute
||No override|Namespace override A|Gateway override A|HTTPRoute override A|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No override|Value in HTTPRoute|Namespace override A| Gateway override A| HTTPRoute override A|
|Namespace override B| Namespace override B| Namespace override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | Namespace override B| Namespace override B|
|Gateway override B| Gateway override B| Namespace override A| Gateway override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically | Gateway override B|
|HTTPRoute override B| HTTPRoute override B | Namespace override A| Gateway override A| HTTPRoute override<br />first created wins<br />otherwise first alphabetically|

#### Defaults interacting with other defaults for RetryOnPolicy, value in HTTPRoute
||No default|Namespace default A|Gateway default A|HTTPRoute default A|
|----|-----|-----|----|----|
|No default|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|
|Namespace default B|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|
|Gateway default B|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|
|HTTPRoute default B|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|Value in HTTPRoute|


## Removing BackendPolicy
BackendPolicy represented the initial attempt to cover policy attachment for
Gateway API. Although this proposal ended up with a similar structure to
BackendPolicy, it is not clear that we ever found sufficient value or use cases
for BackendPolicy. Given that this proposal provides more powerful ways to
attach policy, BackendPolicy was removed.

## Alternatives

### 1. ServiceBinding for attaching Policies and Routes for Mesh
A new ServiceBinding resource has been proposed for mesh use cases. This would
provide a way to attach policies, including Routes to a Service.

Most notably, these provide a way to attach different policies to requests
coming from namespaces or specific Gateways. In the example below, a
ServiceBinding in the consumer namespace would be applied to the selected
Gateway and affect all requests from that Gateway to the foo Service. Beyond
policy attachment, this would also support attaching Routes as policies, in this
case the attached HTTPRoute would split requests between the foo-a and foo-b
Service instead of the foo Service.

![Simple Service Binding Example](images/713-servicebinding-simple.png)

This approach can be used to attach a default set of policies to all requests
coming from a namespace. The example below shows a ServiceBinding defined in the
producer namespace that would apply to all requests from within the same
namespace or from other namespaces that did not have their own ServiceBindings
defined.

![Complex Service Binding Example](images/713-servicebinding-complex.png)

#### Advantages
* Works well for mesh and any use cases where requests don’t always transit
  through Gateways and Routes.
* Allows policies to apply to an entire namespace.
* Provides very clear attachment of polices, routes, and more to a specific
  Service.
* Works well for ‘shrink-wrap application developers’ - the packaged app does
  not need to know about hostnames or policies or have extensive templates.
* Works well for ‘dynamic’ / programmatic creation of workloads ( Pods,etc - see
  CertManager)
* It is easy to understand what policy applies to a workload - by listing the
  bindings in the namespace.

#### Disadvantages
* Unclear how this would work with an ingress model. If Gateways, Routes, and
  Backends are all in different namespaces, and each of those namespaces has
  different ServiceBindings applying different sets of policies, it’s difficult
  to understand which policy would be applied.
* Unclear if/how this would interact with existing the ingress focused policy
  proposal described below. If both coexisted, would it be possible for a user
  to understand which policies were being applied to their requests?
* Route status could get confusing when Routes were referenced as a policy by
  ServiceBinding
* Introduces a new mesh specific resource.

### 2. Attaching Policies for Ingress
An earlier proposal for policy attachment in the Gateway API suggested adding
policy references to each Resource. This works very naturally for Ingress use
cases where all requests follow a path through Gateways, Routes, and Backends.
Adding policy attachment at each level enables different roles to define
defaults and allow overrides at different levels.

![Simple Ingress Attachment Example](images/713-ingress-attachment.png)

#### Advantages
* Consistent policy attachment at each level
* Clear which policies apply to each component
* Naturally translates to hierarchical Ingress model with ability to delegate
  policy decisions to different roles

#### Disadvantages
* Policy overrides could become complicated
* At least initially, policy attachment on Service would have to rely on Service
  annotations or references from policy to Service(s)
* No way to attach policy to other resources such as namespace or ServiceImport
* May be difficult to modify Routes and Services if other components/roles are
  managing them (eg Knative)

### 3. Shared Policy Resource
This is really just a slight variation or extension of the main proposal in this
GEP. We would introduce a shared policy resource. This resource would follow the
guidelines described above, including the `targetRef` as defined as well as
`default` and `override` fields. Instead of carefully crafted CRD schemas for
each of the `default` and `override` fields, we would use more generic
`map[string]string` values. This would allow similar flexibility to annotations
while still enabling the default and override concepts that are key to this
proposal.

Unfortunately this would be difficult to validate and would come with many of
the downsides of annotations. A validating webhook would be required for any
validation which could result in just as much or more work to maintain than
CRDs. At this point we believe that the best experience will be from
implementations providing their own policy CRDs that follow the patterns
described in this GEP. We may want to explore tooling or guidance to simplify
the creation of these policy CRDs to help simplify implementation and extension
of this API.
