# GEP-1651: GatewayAddress Scope

* Issue: [#1651](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1651)
* Status: Provisional

(See status definitions [here](overview.md#status).)

## TLDR

Allow users to configure a GatewayAddress so that it is only reachable within
a specific scope (ie. public/cluster local)

## Goals

- Cluster local gateways can be created in a declarative way `ClusterLocal` and
  are only accessible within a single cluster
- Define a `Public` scope for addresses that are accessible to the internet
- Implementations can define & support their own scopes

## Non-Goals

- Per-request/route scope
- Not a lightweight service mesh

## Introduction

One of the early feature requests for Knative was the ability to deploy an
application using Knative's HTTP routing support, but make it only available
within the cluster. I want to be able to specify both the "internal"
(service.namespace.svc) and "external" (service.namespace.example.com).
Gateways using the same GatewayClass on the cluster, but ensure that the
"internal" service is only reachable within the cluster. This would greatly
simplify deployment for users over the instructions we have today.

The reason why we require an "internal" Gateway is so we can take advantage of
layer 7 load balancing for our internal services.

## API

We propose adding a new `reachability` field under the `spec.infrastructure` stanza of a Gateway.

### Predefined Reachability Values

Implementations MAY implement the following values for 'reachability' and MUST abide by
their defined semantics.

Value | Semantic
-|-
`public`|The address is reachability over the public internet
`cluster`|The address is only reachability within the bounds defined by the [cluster's network model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/networking/#how-to-implement-the-kubernetes-network-model)

### Vendor prefixed values

Implementations can define custom 'reachability' values by specifying a vendor prefix followed
by a slash `/` and a custom name ie. `com.ingress.dev/my-reachability`.

### Default reachability
The default value of `reachability` is implementation specific. It is RECOMMENDED that
the default `reachability` remains consistent for Gateways with the same
`gatewayClassName`.

### Go

```go

type GatewayReachability string

const (
  GatewayReachabilityPublic  GatewayReachability = "public"
  GatewayReachabilityCluster GatewayReachability = "cluster"
)

type GatewaySpec struct {
  // Infrastructure defines infrastructure level attributes about this Gateway instance.
  Infrastructure GatewayInfrastructure `json:"infrastructure"`
  // ...
}
type GatewayInfrastructure struct {
  // AddressScope allows the Gateway to specify the accessibility of it's addresseses
  Reachability GatewayReachability `json:"reachability"`
}
```

### YAML
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  infrastructure:
    reachability: public
  listeners:
  - protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
```

### Semantics

### Unsupported reachability & address values

If a Gateway is unable provide an address for the desired reachability it MUST set the condition `Accepted` to `False`

## Examples

#### 1. Request a GatewayAddress that is only reachable within the same cluster

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  infrastructure:
    reachability: cluster
  listeners:
  - protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
```
#### 2. Request a GatewayAddress with a specific reachability and address
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  infrastructure:
    reachability: cluster
  listeners:
  - protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
  addresses:
  - value: 10.0.0.8
```
#### 3. Request a GatewayAddress that is publically reachable
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  infrastructure:
    reachability: public
  listeners:
  - protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
```

#### 4. Request a GatewayAddress that is a cloud provider's VPC
```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: prod-web
spec:
  gatewayClassName: acme-lb
  infrastructure:
    reachability: some.cloud.dev/vpc
  listeners:
  - protocol: HTTP
    port: 80
```

## Alternatives

### Introducing new GatewayAddress Types

We could introduce additional `AddressTypes` (ie. `ClusterLocalIPAddress`) but
this would lead to a combinatorial explosion as new dimensions (ie. IPv6) are
introduced.

See examples in this comment: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1653#issuecomment-1451246877

### Scope/reachability field on GatewayAddress

This would allow Gateways to have multiple scopes.

See pros/cons here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/pull/1653#issuecomment-1486271913

### Survey of Prior Art

These alternatives are a survey of existing approaches to support cluster
local Gateways. Most are implementation specific and are not portable.

#### Special annotation/label

Istio let's you specify an annotation `networking.istio.io/service-type` to
change the underlying Kubernetes Service type to make it a ClusterIP type.

#### Re-use of AddressType Hostname

Istio let's you re-use existing Gateway deployments by setting the address
type to `Hostname` and the value to the Istio ingress Kubernetes Service. If an
operator configures the Istio deployment to support cluster local traffic a
Gateway implementation can select it using the `HostName` attribute.

#### Multiple Gateway Classes

Some implementations support multiple deployments on a single cluster where
each maps to a GatewayClass. One of these deployments can be configured to serve
cluster local traffic.
