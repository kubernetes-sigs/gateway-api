# GEP-1016: GRPCRoute

* Issue: [#1016](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/issues/1016)
* Status: Experimental

## Goal

Add an idiomatic GRPCRoute for routing gRPC traffic.

## Non-Goals

While certain gRPC implementations support multiple transports and multiple
interface definition languages (IDLs), this proposal limits itself to
[HTTP/2](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2) as
the transport and [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
as the IDL, which makes up the vast majority of gRPC traffic in the wild.

## Introduction

While it would be possible to support gRPC via custom, out-of-tree CRDs, in the long run, this would
lead to a fragmented ecosystem.

gRPC is a [popular RPC framework adopted widely across the industry](https://grpc.io/about/#whos-using-grpc-and-why).
The protocol is used pervasively within the Kubernetes project itself as the basis for
many interfaces, including:

- [the CSI](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/blob/5b0d4540158a260cb3347ef1c87ede8600afb9bf/spec.md),
- [the CRI](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api/blob/49fe8b135f4556ea603b1b49470f8365b62f808e/README.md),
- [the device plugin framework](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/device-plugins/)

Given gRPC's importance in the application-layer networking space and to
the Kubernetes project in particular, we must ensure that the gRPC control plane
configuration landscape does not Balkanize.

### Encapsulated Network Protocols

It is theoretically possible to route gRPC traffic using only `HTTPRoute`
resources, but there are several serious problems with forcing gRPC users to route traffic at
the level of HTTP. This is why we propose a new resource.

In setting this precendent, we must also introduce a coherent policy for _when_
to introduce a custom `Route` resource for an encapsulated protocol for which a
lower layer protocol already exists. We propose the following criteria for such
an addition.

- Users of the encapsulated protocol would miss out on significant conventional features from their ecosystem if forced to route at a lower layer.
- Users of the enapsulated protocol would experience a degraded user experience if forced to route at a lower layer.
- The encapsulated protocol has a significant user base, particularly in the Kubernetes community.

gRPC meets _all_ of these criteria and is therefore, we contend, a strong
candidate for inclusion in the Gateway API.

#### HTTP/2 Cleartext

gRPC allows HTTP/2 cleartext communication (H2C). This is conventionally deployed for
testing. Many control plane implementations do not support this by default and
would require special configuration to work properly.

#### Content-Based Routing

While not included in the scope of this initial GEP, a common use case cited for
routing gRPC is payload-aware routing. That is, routing rules which determine a
backend based on the contents of the protocol buffer payload.

#### User Experience

The user experience would also degrade significantly if forced to route at the level of HTTP.

- Encoding services and methods as URIs (an implementation detail of gRPC)
- The [Transfer Encoding header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding) for trailers
- Many features supported by HTTP/2 but not by gRPC, such as
  - Query parameters
  - Methods besides `POST`
  - [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)


#### Proxyless Service Mesh

The gRPC library supports proxyless service mesh, a system by which routing
configuration is received and acted upon not by an in-line proxy or sidecar
proxy but by the client itself. Eventually, `GRPCRoute` in the Gateway API
should support this feature.  However, to date, there are no HTTP client
libraries capable of participating in a proxyless service mesh.

--- 

### Cross Serving

Occasionally, gRPC users will place gRPC services on the same hostname/port
combination as HTTP services. For example, `foo.com:443/v1` might serve
REST+JSON while `foo.com:443/com.foo.WidgetService/` serves gRPC. Such an
arrangement in the Gateway API poses complex technical challenges. How are
GRPCRoutes to be reconciled with HTTPRoutes? And how should invididual
implementations accomplisht this?

After a long look at the implementations with which the author is familiar, it
was deemed technically infeasible. Furthermore, after surveying the gRPC
community, this was found to be a niche use case to begin with.

In any case, users wishing to accomplish this always have the option of using
`HTTPRoute` resources to achieve this use case, at the cost of a degraded user
experience.

If at some point in the future, demand for this use case increases and we have
reason to believe that the feasibility of implementation has improved, this
would be a backward compatible change.

As such, implementations that support GRPCRoute must enforce uniqueness of
hostnames between `GRPCRoute`s and `HTTPRoute`s. If a route (A) of type `HTTPRoute` or
`GRPCRoute` is attached to a Listener and that listener already has another Route (B) of
the other type attached and the intersection of the hostnames of A and B is
non-empty, then the implementation must reject Route A. That is, the
implementation must raise an 'Accepted' condition with a status of 'False' in
the corresponding RouteParentStatus.


## API

The API deviates from `HTTPRoute` where it results in a better UX for gRPC
users, while mirroring it in all other cases.

### Example `GRPCRoute`

```yaml
kind: GRPCRoute
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
metadata:
  name: foo-grpcroute
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: my-gateway
  hostnames:
  - foo.com
  - bar.com
  rules:
  - matches:
      method:
        service: helloworld.Greeter
        method:  SayHello
      headers:
      - type: Exact
        name: magic
        value: foo

    filters:
    - type: RequestHeaderModifierFilter
      add:
        - name: my-header
          value: foo

    - type: RequestMirrorPolicyFilter
      destination:
        backendRef:
          name: mirror-svc

    backendRefs:
    - name: foo-v1
      weight: 90
    - name: foo-v2
      weight: 10
```

#### Method Matchers

It's been pointed out that the `method` field above stutters. That is, in order
to specify a method matcher, one must type the string `method` twice in a row.
This is an artifact of less-than-clear nomenclature within gRPC. There
_are_ alternatives for the naming here, but none of them would actually be an
improvement on the stutter. Consider the following URI:

`/foo.bar.v1.WidgetService/GetWidget`

- `/foo.bar.v1.WidgetService/GetWidget` is called the method or, less commonly, the _full_ method. 
- `foo.bar.v1.WidgetService` is called the service or, less commonly, the _full_ service (since `WidgetService` can reasonably be called the service)]
- `GetWidget` is called the method.

These terms _could_ be added in, but these names are found almost exclusively
within the various gRPC implementations. And inconsistently across those
implementations.

Therefore, we opt for the stutter over any of the longer names outlined above.

#### Matcher Types

`GRPCRoute` method matchers admits two types: `Exact` and `RegularExpression`.
If not specified, the match will be treated as type `Exact`. Method matchers
will act _as if_ a URI match had been used. A full matrix of equivalent behavior
is provided below:

##### Type Exact

|Service|Method|URI Matcher|
|----------|----------|-----------|
|Specified|Specified|Exact `/${SERVICE}/${METHOD}`|
|Specified|Unspecified|Prefix `/${SERVICE}/`|
|Unspecified|Specified|Suffix `/${METHOD}/` or Regex `/.+/${METHOD}`|
|Unspecified|Unspecified|Not allowed|

##### Type RegularExpression

|Service|Method|URI Matcher|
|----------|----------|-----------|
|Specified|Specified|Regex `/${SERVICE}/${METHOD}`|
|Specified|Unspecified|Regex `/${SERVICE}/.+`|
|Unspecified|Specified|Regex `/.+/${METHOD}`|
|Unspecified|Unspecified|Prefix `/`|

##### Method specified but not Service

In the table above, `Service` unspecified and `Method` specified with type Exact
is listed as being equivalent to a path matcher with type suffix or type regex.
We imagine that many GRPCRoute implementations will be done using translation to
`HTTPRoute`s. `HTTPRoute` does not support a Suffix matcher and its Regex
matcher is specified as "Implementation-specific" support. In order to accommodate
`GRPCRoute` implementations built on top of `HTTPRoute` implementations without
regex support, we list this particular case as having implementation-specific 
support within the context of `GRPCRoute`.

#### Transport

No new `ProtocolType` will be added. While gRPC _does_ have some special
HTTP usage (HTTP/2 cleartext and HTTP/2 without an upgrade from HTTP/1.1),
`GRPCRoute` will be used in conjunction with the existing `HTTP` and `HTTPS`
ProtocolTypes.

Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTPS` `ProtocolType` must
accept HTTP/2 connections without an [initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-6.7). If the
implementation does not support this, then it should raise a "Detached"
condition for the affected listener with a reason of "UnsupportedProtocol"

Implementations supporting `GRPCRoute` with the `HTTP` `ProtocolType` must
support cleartext HTTP/2 connections without an [initial upgrade from HTTP/1.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-6.7). If the implementation does not support this, then it
should raise a "Detached" condition for the affected listener with a reason of
"UnsupportedProtocol"

## Future Enhancements

Many more ideas have been discussed for the `GRPCRoute` resource, but in the
interest of keeping this particular proposal tractable, they have been deferred
for future proposals. Enough thought has been given to these use cases at the
moment, however, that all of the following may be added at a later date in a
backward-compatible manner.

Some of these ideas are:
